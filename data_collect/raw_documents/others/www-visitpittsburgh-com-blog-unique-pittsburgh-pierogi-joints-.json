            "The “P” in Pittsburgh stands for Pierogi and no one will convince me otherwise. During the Industrial Era, Eastern European immigrants flocked here by the thousands to work in the steel industry, open businesses and establish their lives in the United States. They brought with them several dishes we still enjoy today, but perhaps the most well-known is the humble dumpling, the Pierogi.",
            "Dough is rolled out and cut into circles, filling is added, and the dough is turned over to form a pocket of deliciousness. Polish grandmothers across the region would make different versions using traditional Eastern European ingredients such as sauerkraut, farmer’s cheese and my personal favorite, the potato and cheese, in which creamy mashed potatoes are blended with cheese and folded into a pocket of carbohydrate joy.",
            "The dumplings are boiled and then pan fried, and usually served swimming in copious amounts of butter and caramelized onions. It’s comfort food to the max and with the creation of the Mrs. T’s Pierogi Company, can be found in most grocery stores’ frozen food section anywhere in Western Pennsylvania and across the country. I went to five of the top places in Pittsburgh to see their version of this classic dish. From restaurants known for their burgers, to a deli in the Strip District and a surprise Pierogi themed curveball, trying this dish at any of the places below is guaranteed to not disappoint."

                "I know,‘Burghersis known for their smash burgers, not their sides. But I would be remiss if I didn’t include them on this list. To be clear, I don’t generally like deep-fried pierogies. The flash frying can make the dough tough. So, I don’t know what magic they use at ‘Burghers to prevent this from happening, but the fried pierogies they offer as a side are perfectly crunchy, with a pillowy soft inside that will make you forget about the burger on your tray."

These dense delicacies are made by hand and look like they came out of a Polish grandparent’s kitchen. All of the traditional varieties are available, including sauerkraut, potato, farmer’s cheese, and mushroom. I recommend making this your last stop in the Strip District for the day, though, as you won’t want to do much walking after this meal."

These homemade pierogies are served out of a walk-up window, outside of a converted gas station. While they do offer a wide range of Eastern European dishes, we obviously came for the pierogies. They do have a few bistro tables set up outside for seating, but be advised, they only serve the pierogies hot seasonally. In thesummermonths, you order them cold, take them home, and fry them up yourself. It only takes a few minutes and is absolutely worth the time and effort. We tried cottage cheese and chive and the potato and cheddar versions. Mmmm mmmm mmmm!"

One is the Traditional Pierogies appetizer, simply served with those glorious butter-soaked caramelized onions and sour cream. The other is a larger portion as an entrée, accompanied by a variety of pickled vegetables and/or kielbasa. Admittedly, I wasn’t very hungry when I went so I only ordered the appetizer version, halfway through which, I wished I had ordered the larger portion."

And dang it if he wasn’t right. Pizza Pronto is a staple for quality pizza in Oakland and their Pierogi pie is no exception.",
                "A crunchy pizza crust layered with creamy mashed potatoes, onions and a generous amount of both cheddar and mozzarella cheese combine to make this one of the best food surprises for me in recent memory. Pierogies are known as a peasant food. Luxurious isn’t usually a word that goes with them. But since I’m already recommending a pierogi pizza, I might as well go all the way and give it the descriptor that was truly unexpected for me - this pizza is luxurious."
