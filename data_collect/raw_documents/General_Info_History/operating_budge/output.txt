Fiscal Year 2024 

Background

American Rescue Plan

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and it became public law. One 
component  of  the  American  Rescue  Plan  allocated  $350  billion  to  eligible  state,  local,  territorial,  and  Tribal 
governments  to  respond  to  the  COVID-19  emergency.  The  City  of  Pittsburgh  received  an  allocation  totaling 
$335,070,222  from  the  Coronavirus  State  and  Local  Fiscal  Recovery  Fund  (CSLFRF).  The  first  tranche  was 
received in June 2021; the second and final tranche was received in June 2022.

These funds may used in one of the following four statutory categories:

1. To respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency or its negative economic impacts;
2. To  respond  to  workers  performing  essential  work  during  the  COVID-19  public  health  emergency  by 
providing  premium  pay  to  such  eligible  workers  of  the  recipient,  or  by  providing  grants  to  eligible 
employers that have eligible workers who performed essential work;

3. For the provision of government services, to the extent of the reduction in revenue of such recipient due 
to the COVID–19 public health emergency, relative to revenues collected in the most recent full fiscal year 
of the recipient prior to the emergency; and

4. To make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure.

Fiscal Year 2024 

Budget Guide

Overview of the Government of the City of Pittsburgh

The  government  of  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  is  composed  independently  elected  and  appointed  officials  who  work 
alongside  more  than  three  thousand  employees  in  the  service  of  advancing  the  interests  of  City  residents. The 
Mayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote. City Council’s nine representatives are elected to 
office by residents in each of their respective districts.

The  Office  of  the  City  Controller  is  responsible  for  auditing  all  City  expenditures  in  order  to  prevent  wasteful  or 
fraudulent  practices.  Additionally,  the  City  Controller  reviews  and  approves  contracts  and  is  also  charged  with 
reporting  to  the  citizens  of  Pittsburgh,  the  Mayor,  and  City  Council  the  state  of  the  City’s  fiscal  condition.  Every 
year, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information 
on Pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook.

City  Council  proposes,  deliberates,  and  votes  on  legislation  governing  and/or  affecting  the  City.  This  body  also 
approves  appointments,  regulates  revenues  and  expenditures,  and  approves  the  final  Operating  and  Capital 
Budgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of 
City government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.

City Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk. The 
City Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information 
resource  to  Council,  all  City  Departments,  and  the  residents  of  the  City  of  Pittsburgh.  The  City  Council  Budget 
Division monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations.  It prepares and distributes 
to Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City 
of Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special 
reports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.

The  Office  of  the  Mayor  is  the  largest  branch  of  the  government  of  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  and  is  directly 
responsible  for  much  of  the  City’s  daily  operations.  This  work  is  performed  by  individual  Departments,  Offices, 
Bureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to 
debt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law 
acts  as  a  legal  advisor  to  the  Mayor,  City  Council,  and  other  Departments.  Two  units  act  as  umbrella 
organizations. The  Department  of  Public  Safety  Bureau  of Administration  oversees  the  Bureaus  of  Police,  Fire, 
Emergency  Medical  Services,  and  Animal  Care  and  Control,  as  well  as  the  Office  of  Community  Health  and 
Safety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations, 
Environmental Services, and Facilities.

Additionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City’s managerial 
hierarchy  but  whose  sources  of  financing  exist  outside  of  the  City’s  General  Fund.  For  this  reason,  these 
Authorities are not included in the Operating Budget.

A  comprehensive  visualization  of  the  government  of  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  is  included  in  the  organization  chart 
presented in this document.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2024 

What is the Operating Budget?

Budget Guide

The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are 
figures  related  to  planned  expenditures  and  projected  revenues  for  the  upcoming  fiscal  year.  Expenditures  are 
spread  across  all  City  Departments,  Bureaus,  and  Elected  Offices.  These  expenditures  represent  costs  for  the 
administration  and  distribution  of  governmental  services.  These  services  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  public 
safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and 
programming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the 
routine  administration  of  local  government  that  includes  employee  wages  and  health  benefits,  workers’ 
compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.

The  City  collects  revenues  to  finance  the  costs  associated  with  delivering  services  to  residents.  Revenues  are 
collected  by  the  City  from  the  levy  of  taxes,  collection  of  fees  related  to  the  issuance  of  permits  and  licenses, 
charges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other 
revenue generating mechanisms. 

The  Operating  Budget  combines  information  relating  to  expenditures  and  revenues,  creating  a  plan  as  to  what 
governmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal 
year. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in 
delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.

The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and 
Members of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the 
City of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of 
Pittsburgh  must  balance  the  demands  for  services  against  the  available  resources  that  it  can  legally  acquire 
through  tax  and  non-tax  revenue  generating  mechanisms.  Given  the  reality  of  scarce  resources,  the  City  must 
prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the 
City.  The  level  of  funding  allocated  to  individual  Departments  and  programs  within  the  City  clearly  exhibits 
priorities set by the City’s elected public officials.

Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of 
Pittsburgh  in  providing  day-to-day  public  services  must  be  paid  for  out  of  the  Operating  Budget. Therefore,  the 
City of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating 
Budget  can  only  be  altered  through  a  series  of  formal  processes,  which  parallel  those  enacted  in  the  initial 
creation of the plan.

Basis of Accounting

The Fiscal Year

Balanced Budget Mandate

The  General  Fund  budget  is  adopted  on  a  cash  basis  of  accounting,  meaning  that  the  City  of  Pittsburgh 
recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.

The City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of 
each year. This can only be changed by ordinance.

The City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues 
equal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year, 
the budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.

20

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2024 

The City’s Fund Structure

Budget Guide

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City’s financial reporting system is organized on 
a fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.

Governmental Funds

General Fund

Capital Projects Fund

Community Development Funds

Special Revenues Funds

Fiduciary Funds
Pension Trust Fund

 

Agency Funds

The General Fund is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain 
most  of  the  City’s  day-to-day  activities,  including  public  safety,  public  works,  parks,  planning,  and  general 
administration.

The  Capital  Projects  Fund  is  used  to  fund  construction  and/or  maintenance  of  any  public  property,  facility,  or 
program  (such  as  buildings,  park  facilities,  infrastructure,  information  technology  systems)  that  is  expected  to 
provide  a  long-term  benefit  to  the  City. All  projects  funded  by  debt  should  meet  two  requirements:  a  minimum 
value of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from 
three major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on 
the Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 Capital Budget document.

Community  Development  Funds  are  funded  primarily  by  the  federal  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban 
Development  (HUD).  These  funds  are  earmarked  for  projects  relating  to  housing,  economic  development,  and 
human services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.

Special  Revenue  Funds  are  funds  in  which  a  substantial  portion  of  the  proceeds  or  inflows  are  restricted  or 
committed  for  a  specific  purpose.  Examples  of  these  include  the  Liquid  Fuels  Fund,  the  Pittsburgh  Partnership 
Fund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for 
two of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word 
“trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the 
funds are not held by any trustees or custodians.
 
Fiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These 
resources  are  not  available  to  support  the  City  of  Pittsburgh’s  own  operations  and  are  custodial  in  nature.  The 
City’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.

•

•

The  City  administers  three  pensions  for  full  time  employees:  one  for  police  officers,  a  second  for 
firefighters, and a third for municipal employees.

Agency  funds  include  accounts  held  for  employee  benefits,  payroll  withholding,  escheats,  and  tax 
refunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other 
Post-Employment  Benefits)  Trust  Fund,  and  Real  Estate  Tax  Refunds  Trust  Funds  are  examples  of 
Fiduciary Funds.

Budget Allocations

This  budget  document  divides  total  expenditures  across  the  Elected  Offices,  Departments,  and  Bureaus  that 
comprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.

21

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2024 

Budget Guide

The  City  utilizes  a  hierarchical  chart  of  accounts  to  distribute  funds  to  each  Department,  Bureau, Agency,  and 
Elected  Office.  These  accounts  are  organized  by  levels  of  detail,  with  the  individual  object  accounts  being  the 
most specific:

  Fund ... Cost Center

... Subclass ... Object Account

The legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101. Costs are

Costs are next directly assigned to a subclass, which is a general expenditures category. These include personnel 
costs and costs incurred as a result of general operations.

The chart of accounts delineates these subclasses into further detail called object accounts. Object accounts are 
the most detailed level to which the City of Pittsburgh budgets.

Expenditures are both budgeted and recorded using the account string depicted below. The account string begins 
by identifying the fund, followed by the cost center (City division), subclass (expenditure category), object account 
(expenditure  category  detail),  and  fiscal  year.  Below  is  an  example  account  string  that  represents  expenditures

What Are the City's Sources of Revenues?

Annual City of Pittsburgh revenue is generated by both tax and non-tax sources. There are seven subclasses.

Revenues

41  Tax Revenue

42  License and Permit Revenue

43  Charges for Services

44  Fines and Forfeitures

45  Intergovernmental Revenue

46  Interest Earnings

 

47  Miscellaneous Revenues

Tax Revenue

Taxes  comprise  the  majority  of  City  of  Pittsburgh  revenues.  In  addition  to  wage  and  property  taxes,  there  are 
many that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City. 
They are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.

Real estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School 
District, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within 
the City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property 
Assessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2023, the City real estate 
tax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax 
rate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny 
County Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).

Other sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax, 
the  Parking  Tax,  the  Local  Service  Tax,  the Amusement  Tax  and  Non-Resident  Sports  Facility  Usage  Fee,  the 
Deed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax. 

Earned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn 
wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2 
percent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security, 
and capital gains are commonly excluded.

The Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh’s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied 
at the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed 
individuals,  members  of  partnerships,  associations,  joint  ventures  or  other  entities  who  perform  work  or  provide 
services within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.

23

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2024 

Budget Guide

Finally,  the  Parking  Tax  is  collected  from  users  of  private  and  public  parking  facilities  located  within  the  City  of 
Pittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051.

In 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76.5 percent of total City revenue.

City of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for 
the improvement of the City's parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Stop 
the Violence Trust Fund section for more information.

Non-tax Revenue

“Non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not 
directly  involve  the  levying  of  taxes.  Residents  may  be  familiar  with  examples  such  as  building  construction 
permits  and  liquor  and  malt  beverage  licenses.  However,  there  are  other  types  of  non-tax  revenue,  such  as 
interest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue 
for the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.

Each year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of 
grants,  aid,  and  reimbursements  for  services  performed.  For  example,  the  Liquid  Fuels  Tax  object  account 
consists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most 
intergovernmental  funding  comes  from  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  in  the  form  of  pension  aid.  Local 
entities,  such  as  the  Pittsburgh  Parking  Authority  and  the  Pittsburgh  Water  and  Sewer  Authority,  and  federal 
agencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the 
quality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden. 

Many  City  departments  provide  various  services  for  which  rent  or  fees  are  charged.  Examples  of  these  fees 
include payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale 
of  rights  of  way.  In  addition,  the  City  is  compensated  for  services  provided  to  other  municipalities  and 
governmental  entities.  For  example,  Emergency  Medical  Services  collects  fees  after  it  transports  individuals  to 
receive medical care.

In 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23.5 percent of total City revenue.

How Does the City Spend Money?

The tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents 
ranging  from  refuse  pick-up  to  the  regular  maintenance  of  capital  assets.  Expenditures  are  monitored  by 
department or division and by subclass.

Major expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for City 
of  Pittsburgh  employees. The  Operating  Budget  also  pays  the  principal  and  interest  costs  associated  with  past 
and current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. The chart 
below illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) 
contributions, health insurance and workers’ compensation.

24

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2024 

Budget Guide

 

Health Insurance

These  expenditures  are  categorized  within  the  Personnel  –  Employment  Benefits  subclass.  Prior  to  2016  these 
expenditures were budgeted centrally in the Department of Human Resources and Civil Service. Except for retiree 
health  insurance,  these  expenditures  are  budgeted  across  all  divisions  based  on  staffing  levels  and  plan 
elections.

Workers’ Compensation

These  expenditures  are  categorized  within  the  Personnel  –  Employment  Benefits  subclass.  Most  medical, 
indemnity,  and  fees  are  budgeted  across  divisions  with  outstanding  claims.  Legal  and  settlement  expenses 
remain budgeted in the Department of Human Resources and Civil Service with accounts organized as follows: 

Health Insurance

52101  Health Insurance

52111  Other Insurance and Benefits

 

52121  Retiree Health Insurance

Workers' Compensation

Debt Service

Debt service is defined as payments made to the principal and interest balances of previously issued municipal 
bonds in order to ensure their timely retirement. Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of 
Finance and is composed of the following accounts:

Budget Creation Process

The  operating  budget  development  cycle  begins  in  late  spring,  when  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
(OMB)  forwards  a  memorandum  detailing  the  budget  preparation  process  and  general  high  level  expectations, 
policy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by 
City Code.

After receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit 
proposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements, 
requests  for  general  and  project-specific  funding,  and  personnel  position  changes.  The  Mayor  reviews  the 
proposals  to  ensure  that  requests  align  with  citywide  goals  and  strategic  plans/initiatives  and  decides  which,  if 
any, should be funded.

The  Mayor  releases  a  preliminary  budget  at  the  end  of  September.  OMB  hosts  additional  public  meetings  to 
garner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor’s 
strategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.

City Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After 
consideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a 
vote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st.  Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of 
the new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to 
collective  bargaining  agreements)  pay  any  employees.  The  last  time  a  budget  was  not  approved  before 
December 31st was 1931.  

Upon  adoption,  OMB  is  responsible  for  implementing  and  overseeing  the  City  of  Pittsburgh’s  Operating  and 
Capital  Budgets.  Throughout  the  fiscal  year,  OMB  monitors  the  City’s  expenditures  and  revenues,  provides 
legislative  oversight  on  any  matters  related  to  the  budget,  and  oversees  budget  transfers  and  adjustments. 
Analysts  in  OMB  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  performance  of  major  revenue  sources  and  expenditure 
categories,  reports  on  key  factors  driving  the  budget,  reports  on  cash  flow,  and  brief  updates  on  important 
management initiatives.

Five-Year Financial Forecast

Budget Guide

In  addition  to  developing  the  budget,  OMB  and  the  Department  of  Finance  are  responsible  for  estimating  both 
expenditures  and  revenues  for  the  four  years  following  the  next  fiscal  year. Together,  these  estimates  comprise 
the five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.

The five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This 
aids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-
term impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for 
long-term  strategies,  formulating  departmental  and  citywide  initiatives,  and  developing  new  policies  that  might 
result  in  a  financial  impact.  The  financial  forecast  is  an  essential  tool  in  maintaining  financial  discipline,  thus 
ensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.

Revenue Forecast

Revenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and 
deliver  services  to  City  residents.  The  ability  of  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  to  generate  revenue  is  governed  by  the 
rights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
Projected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.

The Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts. 
Previous years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of-
year  financial  data  related  to  all  revenues  are  archived  and  updated  in  the  City’s  enterprise  resource  planning 
(ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue 
line. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.

In addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic 
variables.  These  economic  variables  help  to  inform  how  various  aspects  of  the  economy  can  affect  revenue 
generating  activity  in  the  City.  The  City  also  incorporates  data  from  federal  government  agencies  such  as  the 
Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis  and  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  and  organizations  such  as  Fannie  Mae,  the 
National Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.

Revenue  projections  are  finalized  after  a  series  of  meetings  with  various  stakeholders  related  to  the  City  of 
Pittsburgh’s  Operating  Budget.  The  City  Controller  verifies  that  budgetary  assumptions  and  estimates  are 
developed  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  and  that  revenue  assumptions  are 
reasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections 
are finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.

Expenditure Forecast

OMB  is  responsible  for  developing  the  expenditure  projections  for  the  five-year  forecast.  To  develop  these 
forecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known 
expenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension 
contributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).

OMB  then  develops  forecasts  which  consider  past  year  expenditure  data  and  future  growth,  strategies,  and 
initiatives.  While  most  costs  remain  relatively  static  some  expenditures  lines,  such  as  healthcare  and  fuel,  are 
subject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This 
is accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend,

Lastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described 
above. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in 
achieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests 
and evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that 
fall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast.

How to Read the Budget

Departmental Sections

Throughout  this  budget  document,  financial  data  is  illustrated  in  a  variety  of  ways.  In  general,  each  separate 
section  of  the  document  reports  the  same  financial  data.  The  level  of  detail  is  the  only  substantial  difference 
between each report within a section. 

The most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in 
the Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been 
appropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the 
Departmental Sections of the Operating Budget.

Organization Chart

Budget Guide

The organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau, 
or Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with 
the exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions.

Departmental Overview

Position Summary

At  the  beginning  of  each  departmental  section,  readers  will  find  a  Mission  Statement  which  defines  the 
organization.  The  Mission  Statement  is  followed  by  an  overview  that  provides  a  detailed  description  of  the 
department.  This  section  of  the  narrative  describes  different  functional  areas  within  each  Department, Agency, 
Bureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed.

The  position  summary  lists  all  of  the  budgeted  jobs  within  the  organization.  The  full-time  equivalent,  or  “FTE,” 
represents  the  number  of  full-time  workers  in  the  position.  The  “Rate/Grade”  category  indicates  how  an 
employee’s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees 
can  be  found  as  an  appendix  to  this  document.  For  full  time  positions,  a  “12”  in  the  “Hours/Months”  column 
indicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or 
ending  mid-year.  For  part  time  positions,  the  number  in  this  column  represents  budgeted  hours  of  work.  The 
“Budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The 
“Vacancy Allowance”  adjusts  the  subclass  expenditures  to  account  for  savings  associated  with  vacant  positions 
throughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons.

Subclass Detail

This portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass 
and object account level. For example, the general “Professional and Technical Services” subclass will highlight 
the  appropriation  amounts  for  specific  accounts,  such  as  “Administrative  Fees,”  “Workforce  Training,”  and 
“Computer  Maintenance.”  Readers  can  easily  compare  budgeted  expenditures  from  2023  with  budgeted 
expenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024 
budgeted amounts.

Under the Personnel – Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular salary represents 
the  total  base  pay  for  the  organization.  Longevity  pay  is  awarded  to  employees  in  certain  collective  bargaining 
agreements  based  on  seniority  and  tenure.  Salary  allowances  are  used  to  pay  for  part-time,  temporary,  or 
seasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs 
are listed accordingly. Leave Buyback represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the City. Premium 
Pay  appropriations  compensate  for  overtime  hours.  Reimbursements  are  funds  from  outside  sources  that  are 
used to offset certain position expenses.

Five-Year Forecasts

Note for Fund Accounts

Finally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to 
the 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. The percent change from the prior year is included 
as a reference point.

For  special  revenue  accounts  that  are  included  in  the  Operating  Budget,  the  Fiscal  Year  2024  summary  is 
composed of the “Projected Beginning Balance” for January 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and 
the  “Projected  Ending  Balance”  for  December  31,  2024.  These  funds  carry  over  from  year  to  year.  A  position 
summary follows when appropriate.

parking  and  traffic  tickets,  boot  fees,  and  other  fines  and  forfeitures  from  the  Pittsburgh  Parking  Court  are 
reflected  in  this  revenue.  Revenue  estimates  for  traffic  court  are  net  of  estimated  costs  of  operating  the  court 
incurred  by  the  Pittsburgh  Parking  Authority.  Collectively,  the  Traffic  Court  and  tickets  issued  by  the  Parking 
Authority are responsible for generating 97.7 percent of Fines and Forfeiture revenue, $895,723 and $7,592,279, 
respectively.

Intergovernmental Revenue

Intergovernmental revenues are budgeted at $42,015,764 in fiscal year 2024. Grant revenues are awarded to the 
City  by  various  agencies  at  the  Federal,  State,  and  Local  levels.  Additionally,  annual  payments  are  made  by 
authorities  in  lieu  of  taxes  and  for  reimbursement  of  services  performed  by  the  City  at  the  request  of  the 
authorities. Local and Federal intergovernmental revenue represents 1.2 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, of 
the  subclass.  Revenue  sourced  from  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  is  the  largest  category  within  this 
subclass, accounting for the remaining 98.2 percent. The largest account relates to State Pension Aid, which is 
budgeted at $26,575,505 or 63.3 percent of all intergovernmental revenue. The $10,000,000 2% Local Share of 
Slots  Revenue  is  the  second  largest  account,  comprising  an  additional  23.8  percent  of  intergovernmental 
revenue.

Interest and Miscellaneous Revenue

Interest earnings are budgeted at $16,545,503 in fiscal year 2024. This revenue is derived from interest earnings 
investments  in  Treasury  Bills,  Certificates  of  Deposit,  and  other  insured  and/or  collateralized  instruments  of 
investment as permitted under the City’s investment policy. Miscellaneous revenues are budgeted at $46,843,825. 
This amount consists of revenues that cannot be classified, transfers from Trust Funds to the General Fund, and 
proceeds. The American Rescue Plan funding is considered a transfer from its isolated Trust Fund.

Revenue Narrative

 

 Revenue

The following revenue forecasts are intended to provide policy makers and the public with a revenue baseline to 
inform  the  budget  process.  The  forecasts  are  based  on  economic  assumptions,  recent  collection  trends,  and 
current  laws  and  policies.  However,  actual  revenues  could  vary  from  forecasts  due  to  unforeseeable  economic 
and technical factors.

2024 Operating Budget Revenue

Revenues are divided into tax and non-tax revenues. In 2024, tax revenues are budgeted at approximately $541.8 
million  and  non-tax  revenues  are  budgeted  at  $172.4  million,  comprising  approximately  75.9  percent  and  24.1 
percent  of  total  revenues,  respectively. Total  revenues  are  forecast  to  increase  by  2.5  percent  in  2024  over  the 
2023 budget. 

Tax Revenue

Real Estate Tax

Tax  revenues  incorporate  all  major  taxes  that  are  levied  by  the  City  of  Pittsburgh.  For  each  tax,  total  revenues 
include  current  year  collections,  prior  year  collections  and  penalties  and  interest.  Tax  revenues  are  forecast  to 
increase by 1.2 percent in 2024 over the 2023 budget and to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.

Total real estate tax revenues are budgeted at $151.8 million in 2024, an estimated 4.7 percent decrease from the 
prior  year.  The  real  estate  tax  is  the  largest  source  of  revenue  in  the  2024  Operating  Budget,  comprising 
approximately  28.0  percent  of  tax  revenues  and  21.3  percent  of  total  revenues.  Current  year  real  estate  tax 
liability  (the  amount  billed  at  the  beginning  of  the  year)  is  calculated  by  applying  the  millage  rate  (8.06  mils)  to 
Allegheny  County's  assessed  value  of  property.  On  average,  residential  property  comprises  approximately  55 
percent  of  the  total  assessed  value  of  property  in  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  and  non-residential  property  comprises 
approximately  45  percent.  Prior  to  the  county-wide  reassessment  effective  in  2013,  the  total  assessed  value  of 
property  in  the  City  grew  by  approximately  1.2  percent  on  average  per  year  since  2003.  The  county-wide 
reassessment led to appeals, most notably for non-residential property, and the total assessed value decreased 
by 7.8 percent in 2014. Since then, the total assessed value of property has grown by 1.1 percent on average per 
year, more in line with historical growth. 

The largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the 
Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000 property tax relief (for senior citizens who meet certain requirements), and the 2 
percent early-filer discount. Non-profits are exempt from this tax.  Real estate tax incentives for future years are 
estimated as an average percentage of tax liability based on data since the reassessment. Total real estate tax 
revenues are forecast to increase by 0.8 percent each year through 2028.

Earned Income Tax

Payroll Preparation Tax

Total earned income tax revenues are budgeted at $136.2 million in 2024, an estimated 7.3 percent increase over 
the prior year. The earned income tax is a 1.25 percent levy on the wages and net profits of residents of the City 
of Pittsburgh. The earned income tax forecast projects tax year liabilities based on a 3.0 percent growth rate, with 
a downward adjustment for the City of Pittsburgh, and splits current and prior year liabilities based on historical 
collections. Total earned income tax revenues are forecast to increase by 4.4 percent each year through 2028.  

Total payroll preparation tax revenues are budgeted at $76.3 million in 2024, an estimated 16.0 percent increase 
over the prior year. The payroll preparation tax is levied at a rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers 
and  net  income  from  self-employed  individuals,  members  of  partnerships,  associations  and  joint  ventures  who 
perform work or provide services within the City of Pittsburgh.  Non-profits an exempt from this tax. The payroll 

40

Fiscal Year 2024 

 

 Revenue

preparation tax forecast uses total non-farm wages for Allegheny County to forecast future revenues. Total non-
farm wages for Allegheny County are forecast to increase by 4.0 percent on average. Total payroll preparation tax 
revenues are forecast to increase by 2.2 percent each year through 2028.

Parking Tax

Deed Transfer Tax

Total parking tax revenues are budgeted at $51.6 million in 2024, a 1.9 percent decrease from the prior year. The 
parking  tax  is  levied  at  a  rate  of  37.5  percent  on  fees  charged  for  parking  or  storing  cars  within  the  City  of 
Pittsburgh. The parking tax forecast uses a multivariate regression with collections as the dependent variable and 
the  tax  rate  and  gross Allegheny  County  product  as  independent  variables.  Estimated  gross Allegheny  County 
product is the total value of goods produced and services provided in the county, and serves as a broad economic 
indicator of activity in and around the City. Total parking tax revenues are forecast to increase by 3.7 percent each 
year through 2028. 

Deed transfer tax revenues are budgeted at $59.1 million in 2024, an estimated 13.7 percent decrease compared 
with the prior year. This decrease is related to fewer property transactions in comparison to last year as a result of 
rising interest rates.  The tax is levied at a rate of 3 percent on real property transfers within the City of Pittsburgh. 
The total tax paid, which is typically split between the buyer and seller of a property, is 5% as of 2020, as the state 
and school board each also levy 1% taxes of their own.  

The  deed  transfer  tax  forecast  (provided  by  IHS  Markit)  uses  a  multivariate  regression  with  collections  as  the 
dependent  variable  and  three  independent  variables.  The  first  independent  variable  is  the  residential  tax  base, 
which  consists  of  existing  single-family  home  sales  multiplied  by  the  average  price  of  an  existing  single-family 
home. The  other  independent  variables  are  the  tax  rate  and  a  dummy  variable  for  years  in  which  the  sale  of  a 
non-residential property exceeded $100 million. Total deed transfer tax revenues are forecast to increase by 1.2 
percent on average each year over the next five years.

Regional Asset District Tax Relief

Regional Asset District tax relief is budgeted at $25.8 million in 2024, an estimated 3.3 percent increase over the 
prior year. This relief, created by Pennsylvania Act 77 of 1993, provides the City of Pittsburgh with a percentage of 
1/4 of the 1 percent additional sales tax in Allegheny County. The City of Pittsburgh’s percentage is determined by 
a  formula  that  compares  the  City’s  tax  revenues  and  the  market  value  of  property  per  capita  with  that  of  all 
municipalities  in  Allegheny  County.  Retail  sales  (a  proxy  for  sales  tax  collections)  are  forecast  to  grow  by  3.1 
percent  on  average  over  the  same  period.  Act  77  tax  relief  is  forecast  to  increase  by  2.0  percent  each  year 
through 2028.

Amusement Tax

Total amusement tax revenues are budgeted at $18.9 million in 2024, an estimated 9.2 percent increase over the 
prior  year.  The  amusement  tax  is  levied  at  a  rate  of  5  percent  on  the  gross  admission  to  events  that  provide 
entertainment  within  the  City  of  Pittsburgh,  excluding  non-profit  performing  arts  organizations.  Amusement  tax 
collections are primarily motivated by sporting events within the City. Revenues from the three professional sports 
teams have historically comprised 70 percent of amusement tax revenues on average per year. Revenues from 
opposing teams and non-resident performers comprise the remainder of the amusement tax revenues. A sports 
teams and clubs economic indicator is used to forecast 70 percent of amusement tax revenues. The remaining 30 
percent  is  forecast  with  consumer  price  index  (inflation)  to  generate  a  more  conservative  forecast.  Total 
amusement tax revenues are forecast to increase by 2.6 percent each year through 2028.

Local Service Tax

 

 Revenue

Total local service tax revenues are budgeted at $15.7 million in 2024, an estimated 3.2 percent increase over the 
prior year. The local service tax is a weekly tax of $1 per employee working within the City of Pittsburgh earning 
greater  than  $12,000  annually. The  local  service  tax  forecast  uses  annual  employment  forecasts  for  the  City  of 
Pittsburgh to project revenues. Total local service tax revenues are forecast to decrease by 0.6 percent per year 
through 2028.

Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee

To offset the revenue loss from phasing out the tax on non-profit performing arts organizations, the non-resident 
sports  facility  usage  fee  was  established  in  2005.  Total  non-resident  sports  facility  usage  fee  revenues  are 
budgeted at $4.4 million in 2024, an estimated 99.3 percent increase over the prior year. The fee is 3 percent of 
the earned income generated by non-residents using a publicly funded facility to engage in an athletic event or 
performance.  This results in a conservative forecast with growth slightly above the consumer price index. Total 
non-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are forecast to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.

Telecommunication Licensing Fee

The telecommunication licensing fee is budgeted at $1.2 million in 2024, a 26.5 percent decrease compared with 
the prior year. The fee is levied on telecommunications companies for the privilege of running lines under public 
streets, bridges and sidewalks. Total telecommunication licensing fee collections are forecast to increase by 1.0 
percent each year through 2028.

Institution and Service Privilege Tax

The  institution  and  service  privilege  tax  is  budgeted  at  $460,644  in  2024,  an  estimated  16.8  percent  decrease 
over the prior year. The tax is levied on the gross income of foundations, partnerships and non-profit organizations 
that  provide  a  public  service.  Total  revenues  are  forecast  to  increase  by  2.7  percent  each  year  through  2028, 
roughly in line with inflation. 

Non-Profit Payments for Services

Outdoor Advertising Excise Tax

Non-profit payments for services are contractual payments from the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh for 
some of their properties that have been taken off the tax rolls. The total budget for this line item is $438,891 in 
2024.

City Council enacted an outdoor advertising excise tax in 2013. This tax on billboards was estimated to bring in 
$1.2 to $2.0 million dollars annually to the City. This tax is currently in litigation; no tax revenue has been collected 
by the City.  

Non-Tax Revenues

Licenses and Permits

Non-tax revenues are divided into six categories: licenses and permits, charges for service, fines and forfeitures, 
intergovernmental  revenue,  interest  earnings,  and  miscellaneous  revenues.  Non-tax  revenues  are  forecast  to 
increase by 6.9 percent in 2024 over the prior year and decrease by 6.1 percent each year through 2028.

Total  revenues  for  the  licenses  and  permits  category  are  budgeted  at  $17.1  million  in  2024,  an  estimated  7.2 
percent  increase  over  the  prior  year.  Licenses  account  for  5.0  percent  of  this  revenue  and  permits  account  for 
94.7  percent  2024.  Licenses  are  issued  to  businesses  and  vendors  for  a  variety  of  purposes  (e.g.,  poker 
machines,  parking  lots,  and  pool  tables).  The  largest  source  of  license  revenue  is  liquor  and  malt  beverage

generally issued for building construction and renovation. The largest source of permit revenues are commercial 
building permits, budgeted at $5.5 million in 2024. Total license and permit revenues are forecast to increase by 
4.5 percent each year through 2028.  

Chapter  170  of  the  City  Code  requires  City  Council  to  annually  authorize  a  fee  schedule  for  all  licenses  and 
permits.  The  master  fee  schedule  is  a  separate  piece  of  legislation  from  the  appropriations  and  salaries 
resolutions contained in this budget document.

Charges for Service

Total  revenues  for  the  charges  for  service  category  are  budgeted  at  $41.2  million  in  2024,  an  estimated  6.9

Expenditure Summary

Fiscal Year 2024 Expenditures

Expenditures

Expenditures total $684,553,037 in fiscal year 2024. The five largest divisions in fiscal year 2024, with respect to 
total appropriated budget, are: Department of Finance, Bureau of Police, Bureau of Fire, Department of Human 
Resources and Civil Service, and the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. In total, these departments account 
for  70.4  percent  of  total  expenditures  in  the  2024  Operating  Budget.  The  Department  of  Finance’s  budget  is 
particularly  large  because  all  debt  service  and  pension  related  costs  are  appropriated  within  the  department’s 
budget. Similarly, appropriations placed in the Department of Human Resources budget include legacy citywide 
retiree health benefits.

In addition to representing 2024 expenditures by department, the data can also be viewed by functional area. The 
following chart illustrates the percent of total budget represented by functional area in 2024.

General Government

General  Government  comprises  14  individual  Departments,  Bureaus,  Offices,  and  Commissions  which  account 
for  $335,543,299  or  49.0  percent  of  total  budgeted  expenditures  in  fiscal  year  2024.  Divisions  falling  under  this 
category are: Office of the Mayor; Office of Management and Budget; Department of Innovation and Performance; 
Commission  on  Human  Relations;  Department  of  Finance;  Department  of  Law;  Ethics  Hearing  Board;  Office  of 
Municipal  Investigations;  Department  of  Human  Resources  and  Civil  Service;  Department  of  City  Planning; 
Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections; Department of Parks and Recreation; Department of Mobility 
and Infrastructure; and the Citizen Police Review Board. Some of these departments are administrative in function 
while  others  are  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operations  and  direct  delivery  of  programs  and  services  to  city 
residents.  Note  that  the  Commission  on  Human  Relations,  Ethics  Hearing  Board,  and  Citizen  Police  Review 
Board have independent advisory boards.

Public Safety

The Department of Public Safety in the City of Pittsburgh is comprised of five bureaus and one office: Bureau of 
Administration, Bureau of Emergency Medical Services, Bureau of Police, Bureau of Fire, Bureau of Animal Care 
and  Control,  Office  of  Community  Health  and  Safety.  In  total  these  budgets  equate  to  $264,204,691  or  38.6

divisions.

Public Works

The  Department  of  Public  Works  in  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  is  comprised  of  four  individual  bureaus:  Bureau  of 
Administration, Bureau of Operations, Bureau of Environmental Services, and Bureau of Facilities. In total these 
budgets equate to $74,563,534 or 10.9 percent of total budgeted expenditures. Public Works is responsible for a 
breadth of City services including refuse collection, snow removal, maintenance of parks and streets, and other 
essential services.

City Council and the Office of the City Controller

The City Council budgets amount to $5,296,106 or 0.8 percent of total budgeted expenditures. The Office of the 
City Controller budget amounts to $4,945,407 or 0.7 percent of total budgeted expenditures. For descriptions of 
these government sections, please refer to “Overview of the Government of the City of Pittsburgh” section in the 
2024 Operating Budget Guide.

Expenditures by Subclass

Expenditures can be divided into two categories: personnel related and non-personnel related. Personnel related 
expenditures  include  salaries  and  employee  benefits  including  healthcare,  workers’  compensation  benefits, 
pension  benefits,  and  retiree  benefits.  In  total  these  expenditures  account  for  $502,900,326  or  73.5  percent  of 
total expenditures budgeted in fiscal year 2024.

The subclass breakdown of total budget expenditures illustrates the proportion of the budget that is dedicated to 
personnel-related  expenditures,  professional  and  technical  services,  property  services,  other  services,  supplies, 
property,  miscellaneous  expenses,  and  debt  service.  Of  the  $181,652,712  budget  in  non-personnel  related 
expenditures in fiscal year 2024, $69,390,272 or 38.2 percent is dedicated to repaying the principal and interest 
costs of issued bonds. These bonds are used to finance capital infrastructure projects throughout the City.

Five-Year Expenditure Forecast

The  2024  Operating  Budget  and  Five-Year  Plan  submitted  by  the  City  highlights  the  Mayor's  commitment  to 
financial  sustainability,  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  government  operations,  and  strengthening 
financial management practices. The City plans to achieve these by:

Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services

•
• Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations
•

Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and 
provide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases

• Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary

The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and 
improve the City’s long-term fiscal health by:

Allocating  an  additional  $243  million  to  the  pension  fund  over  five  years  beyond  the  state  mandated 
minimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC)
Continuing  efforts  of  responsible  borrowing  with  the  City’s  debt  burden  totaling  10.1  percent  of  General 
Fund expenditures in 2024
Allocating a $22.0 million in "pay-as-you-go" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan

In  addition  to  the  information  outlined  in  the  revenue  and  expenditure  sections  of  the  budget  document,  key 
components and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following:

Salaries  &  Wages:  OMB  will  continue  to  work  with  departments  to  identify  opportunities  to  increase 
workplace  productivity  and  implement  other  operational  efficiencies  as  part  of  the  enterprise  cost 
management initiative.
Employee  Benefits:  This  category  includes  all  health  care  costs  for  both  active  and  retired  employees, 
workers'  compensation  costs,  employer  mandated  costs  such  as  social  security,  and  employer 
contributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few 
years, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee

health  and  managing  costs.  Pension  projections  incorporate  initiatives  related  to  increased  pension 
funding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.

•

• Other  Non-Personnel  Operating  Costs:  Projections  for  this  category  incorporate  contractually  required 
costs that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across 
each department. 
Debt  Service:  The  forecast  assumes  that  with  the  significant  reduction  in  debt  service  that  occurred  in 
2019, the City will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the City’s critical infrastructure 
needs.
PAYGO: The  City  funds  a  number  of  capital  projects  through  a  transfer  from  the  General  Fund  into  the 
Capital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the City spends on 
capital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2024 Capital 
Improvement  Plan,  projects  funded  with  PAYGO  are  mainly  focused  on  neighborhood  improvement, 
economic  development,  and  blight  remediation.  The  forecast  assumes  that  the  City  will  continue  to 
contribute  PAYGO  funds  for  capital  projects  consistent  with  Chapter  218  of  the  City  Code,  contributing 
$22 million in 2024 and a total of $21.1 million from 2025 to 2028.

•

Most  non-personnel  related  subclasses  are  projected  to  remain  relatively  flat  or  increase  modestly  throughout 
fiscal year 2028. Debt Service will decrease significantly in 2027.

The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan achieves substantial improvements in terms of the percentage of 
total  expenditures  related  to  debt  service.  In  fiscal  year  2015  expenditures  related  to  debt  service  reached 
$89,289,167. This represented 18.6 percent of total budgeted expenditures. In the 2024 Operating Budget, total 
planned expenditures related to debt service is $69,390,272, or 10.1 percent of total budgeted expenditures. This 
trend illustrates the City’s commitment to long term financial health. The long term impact of this plan will allow the 
City to responsibly borrow at more favorable rates, comply with the City’s debt policy, and provide resources to 
invest in the City’s assets.

Description of Services

  City Council Districts
 101100

City Council is the legislative branch of government and consists of nine members.  Each Member represents one 
Council  District,  and  is  appointed  to  be  the  chairperson  of  a  committee  which  corresponds  to  one  or  more  City 
Departments. Council carries out duties in accordance with the Home Rule Charter and the laws of the state, and 
is primarily responsible for making laws which govern the City of Pittsburgh. City Council proposes, debates, and 
votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also approves appointments as provided by the 
Charter, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final operating and capital budgets for the City.  
Since the legislative power of the City is solely vested in the Council, the introduction of legislation necessary for 
the operations of all City Departments must be introduced by City Council members through their representative 
committees.  Council  members  also  introduce  ordinances  and  resolutions  which  directly  address  policy  and 
budgetary issues. 

City  Council  is  entrusted  with  the  review  and  approval  of  all  City  laws.  Council  members  interact  with  City 
Departments, other units of government, and the general public as a means to obtain information pertinent to their 
decision-making process.

Description of Services

  Council as a Body
 101200

Council as a Body provides City Council with centralized staff support. The City Clerk is elected by members of 
City Council every three years and is responsible for the due, proper, and faithful performance of all operational 
matters of City Council.

Under the direction of Council, the Clerk Division coordinates and schedules all official City Council meetings and 
public  hearings  and  provides  constituent  and  legislative  support.  This  Division  oversees,  guides,  tracks  and 
records  the  entire  legislative  process,  from  the  introduction  of  proposed  legislation  to  final  approval  and 
publication. All proposed ordinances and resolutions are submitted for processing. This Division also oversees the 
signature process on all approved legislation. The City Clerk records the legislation to the Municipal Record Book.  

The  Records  Management  Division  serves  as  a  document  and  information  resource  for  City  Council,  City 
Departments, and all government and outside entities and the general public. The Records Management Division 
is responsible for maintaining a citywide records management system.  They maintain custody, control, filing, and 
storage  of  all  legislation,  books,  papers,  minutes  and  other  written  and  recorded  documents  and  material 
pertaining to the operation of City government.

The  City  Council  Budget  Division  monitors  City  finances  and  conducts  analysis  of  City  operations  and  policy 
matters.   This  Division  analyzes  all  legislation  relating  to  finances  that  pass  through  City  Council,  prepares  and 
distributes to Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures and other financial trends relative to the financial 
operation and fiscal condition of the City. The Division produces, supervises, and reviews the City’s final annual 
operating, capital, and Community Development budgets and compiles special reports and executive summaries 
for Council to assist them in their deliberations.

Other Divisions include the Public Engagement Division, the Health Division, and the Solicitor Division.

Mission

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The  mission  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  ("OMB")  is  to  ensure  the  effective  and  efficient  use  of 
available resources in order to sustain the delivery of quality services to the residents of the City of Pittsburgh.

The Office of Management and Budget is organized into the following core teams to strengthen citywide financial 
and grant management:

Management  -  This  team  provides  overall  leadership  and  direction  for  the  City  and  oversees  departmental 
planning and management functions.

Capital and Asset Management - This team is responsible for the preparation and implementation of the annual 
capital  budget  and  six-year  capital  improvement  program;  planning  and  administration  of  the  City’s  asset 
management  function;  and  the  development  and  financial  oversight  of  the  City’s  long-term  infrastructure 
investment plan. 

Community Development - This team coordinates programs that provide the City with resources to address a 
wide  range  of  unique  community  needs.  The  primary  goals  of  the  Community  Development  Division  are  to 
improve housing conditions; foster community and economic development; improve public facilities; and improve 
and  enhance  the  quality  of  life  for  residents  of  the  City  of  Pittsburgh,  most  specifically  those  with  low-income.  
These initiatives are funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and include the following 
programs: Community Development Block Grant ('CDBG"), Home Investment Partnership ('HOME"), Emergency 
Shelter Grant ("ESG"), and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS ("HOPWA").

Operating and Special Revenue - This team is responsible for the preparation and implementation of the annual 
operating  budget  and  five-year  forecast;  long-term  financial  planning;  financial  policy  development;  maximizing 
opportunities  to  pursue,  secure,  and  effectively  administer  grants  from  federal,  state,  county,  corporate,  and 
foundation  partners;  leading  the  transformation  of  the  City’s  finance  functions,  talent,  processes,  and 
technologies;  and  the  management  of  enterprise-wide  projects  that  will  have  a  significant  financial  and/or 
operational impact. The Grants Office is housed within this group.

Procurement  -  This  team  is  responsible  for  organizing  and  directing  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the 
procurement 
technology;  and 
implementing cost management initiatives related to procurement, warehousing, and inventory management.

while  also  improving  IT  service  responsiveness  for  all  City  workers.  I&P  will  also  continue  supporting  all  other 
departments  to  implement  enterprise  applications,  data  governance  and  analytics,  and  apply  best  practices  in 
project  management.    Further,  I&P  engages  and  partners  with  colleagues  across  all  departments  to  drive 
innovation,  process  improvement  and  operational  excellence  across  the  city  on  behalf  of  the  residents  of

Commission on Human Relations
 105000

Mission

The  Commission  on  Human  Relations  is  the  official  Civil  Rights  agency  for  the  City  of  Pittsburgh,  and  is 
empowered  by  Chapters  651-659  of  the  Pittsburgh  City  Code  to  enforce  Civil  Rights  laws,  eliminate 
discrimination, and deal with matters of inter-group conflict.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Commission receives and investigates complaints of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and 
public accommodations within the jurisdiction of the City. The Commission also provides outreach and education 
services  regarding  rights  and  responsibilities  under  the  Fair  Practices  Ordinances  (PCC:  651-659).  These 
functions are performed within the following program areas:

Unlawful  Practices  Administration  and  Enforcement  -  As  provided  in  the  City  Code,  the  Commission’s 
mandate  is  to  receive,  investigate,  and  adjudicate  complaints  of  discriminatory  practices  in  the  areas  of 
employment,  housing,  and  public  accommodations.  This  office  is  also  charged  with  the  responsibility  for  the 
receipt,  investigation,  and  adjudication  of  complaints  alleging  civil  rights  violations  by  City  employees  in  the 
exercise of their duties as City employees. The Commission is charged with seeking the satisfactory resolution or 
adjustment of all complaints through negotiation, mediation, and conciliation.
  
Inter-Group/Police  Community  Relations  -  The  Commission  studies,  investigates,  holds  public  hearings,  and 
conciliates  issues  in  the  community  that  adversely  affect  inter-group  relations,  negatively  impact  the  livability  of 
city neighborhoods, and lead to civil unrest. 

 

Education and Outreach - The Commission provides information on the laws it enforces and its work in the area 
of community relations through the use of a wide variety of tools including presentations and programs specifically 
targeted  to  reach  the  particular  needs  of  all  segments  of  the  population,  including  the  City  workforce.  These 
services complement the Commission’s work in the area of enforcement and serve to reduce prejudice, enhance 
inter-group relations, increase understanding of our need for unity, and bring about a greater level of awareness 
and compliance with the law.  The Commission also work to further the City’s commitment to the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), especially those focused on peace, justice, and strong institutions.

revenues).  The  Controller  also  conducts  audits  of  all  city  departments  and  city  authorities  such  as  the  Urban 
Redevelopment  Authority  (URA),  Pittsburgh  Parking  Authority,  Pittsburgh  Water  and  Sewer  Authority  and  the 
Pittsburgh  Housing  Authority.  Through  audits  of  city  departments  and  authorities,  the  Controller  makes 
recommendations  on  how  to  make  those  departments  more  effective,  efficient  and  how  to  better  spend  city  tax 
dollars.

Mission

The  Finance  Department  provides  fiscal  leadership  for  the  City  focused  on  long-term  financial  health  while 
respecting  the  interests  of  its  residents.    It  also  carries  an  important  responsibility  to  ensure  all  entrepreneurs, 
visionaries, and leaders have the necessary services and city infrastructure to thrive.  As the City of Pittsburgh’s 
primary revenue generator, the Finance Department is committed to excellence in financial management for the 
City, its residents, and its businesses.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Finance Department is responsible for the collection, deposit, and investment of all funds received by the City 
from  any  source.  The  Department  bills  and  collects  tax  and  fee  revenue,  intergovernmental  payments,  grant 
payments, lease payments, and other payments due to the City. The Department also manages tax abatements 
(including homestead and senior citizen exemptions), tracks tax increments, and performs tax audits designed to 
help businesses submit returns timely and enforce tax laws. The Department is also the designated tax collector 
for the Pittsburgh School District and the Carnegie Library.

In addition to collections of revenue, the Finance Department performs a number of other functions. This includes 
the  sale  of  tax  delinquent  properties  through  Treasurer’s  Sales,  sale  of  City-owned  property,  tax  assessment 
appeals, and citywide cash management. The Department performs business tax audits and ensures that money 
owed  to  the  City  is  collected  in  a  timely  manner.  The  Department  also  manages  City  debt  through  bonds  and 
borrowing  and  manages  the  City’s  Comprehensive  Municipal  Pension  Trust  Fund.  To  ensure  accuracy  and 
transparency the Department also facilitates citywide annual single and pension audits.

The Department has five major divisions, each with several sub-sections, led by the Director and Deputy Director.  

Administration  and  Treasury  Division  -  The  Director  of  Finance  oversees  all  departmental  functions  and 
policies and is responsible for managing debt functions. The Director also oversees all collections and billing of 
taxes as City Treasurer and is responsible for communicating and interacting with the City Council. The Director/ 
City  Treasurer  units  are  responsible  for  managing  all  administrative  functions.  The  City  Treasurer  is  the 
designated Treasurer for the Pittsburgh School District, is responsible for tax collections related to the District, and 
is the responsible agent for the collection and distribution of the Carnegie Library portion of real estate taxes. The 
Treasurer oversees the collection of the earned income tax through the City’s contractor, Jordan Tax Services.

Business  Intelligence  Division  - The  Business  Intelligence  Unit  (BIU)  reports  to  the  Director  of  Finance. This 
unit is responsible for all operation improvement projects within the Department as well as citywide organizational 
processes and performance. This unit manages all requests for proposals originating in the department, manages 
projects  to  include  major  technology  updates,  and  recommends  and  implements  new  datasets  and  open  data 
initiatives. The Business Intelligence Unit is also responsible for managing the credit card programs citywide and 
all legislation processes required to manage citywide contracts. It is also responsible for creating policies to align 
with  department  goals  to  increase  efficiency  and  productivity.  The  unit  focuses  on  improvements  that  will  help 
increase revenue as well as lower operational costs citywide. 

Real  Estate  Division  -  This  unit  manages  all  real  estate  activity  including  property  tax,  city  property  sales, 
Treasurer's sales as well as abatement and delinquencies. The Real Estate division is the designated collector for 
the Pittsburgh School District and Carnegie Library and ensures that the property tax and any delinquencies on 
accounts  are  collected  for  the  current  year.  The  Real  Estate  division  manages  the  entire  real  estate  inventory 
online for the public to search and apply for properties that are for sale. The division works with property buyers, 
delinquency collectors, the School District, County Assessor’s Office, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, and the 
Law department to return property to the tax rolls and expedite the sales processes.

Tax Compliance Division - This division houses all compliance and enforcement activities and is the front facing 
counter  that  manages  tax  compliance  letters  and  new  business  registrations.  The  tax  compliance  team  is 
responsible  for  discovering  new  businesses,  collecting  business  taxes  and  fees,  performing  audits  and 
investigations, and issuing citations to ensure that all money owed is collected and that taxpayers comply with the 
City ordinance.  

Cash  Management  Division  -  This  unit  ensures  all  collections  are  processed  timely  and  accurately.  This  area 
includes cashiering, imaging, data entry, investment, insurance and bonds, ACH grants, and all activities related 
to  the  City  Controller’s  daily  revenue  posting. The  division  expedites  the  deposit  and/or  transfer  of  revenues  to 
manage the distribution of funds citywide.

Mission

The Department of Law provides legal advice and serves as in-house corporate counsel to the City of Pittsburgh, 
which often involves providing advice to the Mayor, City Directors, City Council, and various governmental units.  
It represents the City in all legal aspects of its daily governmental functions.  It also represents the City in all cases 
which  impact  public  policy  and  City  residents’  quality  of  life.  The  Department  of  Law  operates  as  a  quality, 
proactive boutique law firm attracting talented professionals with impeccable integrity from the public and private 
sector.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Department of Law is divided into several general service areas or divisions as follows:

constitutionality,  review  of  all  City  contracts,  the  handling  of  real  estate  matters,  zoning  issues,  environmental 
issues (non-litigation), and other proceedings before regulatory agencies.  This division also responds directly to 
all departments and City Council for advice and counsel when needed.

public at large while complying with the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law.

2023 Accomplishments
 

•

•

•

Drafted and executed contracts  for URA ARPA  allocation.  The contracts support a variety of initiatives, 
such  as  addressing  the  City’s  need  for  affordable  housing,  including  supporting  the  creation  or 
preservation  of  affordable  rental  units  and  affordable  for-sale  units  and  assisting  low-  and  moderate-
income homebuyers, providing funding to carry out projects to address blighted or abandoned properties 
within  the  City,  and  programs  to  support  small  businesses  or  nonprofits  that  experienced  negative 
economic impacts from the pandemic.  
Litigated three federal jury trials within a three-month period.  For all of the cases, the jury returned a full 
defense verdict in favor of the City.
Challenged  the  status  of  26  tax-exempt  properties  on  the  basis  that  the  properties  were  not  used  for  a 
truly charitable purpose, bringing new tax dollars into the City and having the property owners pay their 
fair share.

Mission
 
The  mission  of  the  Ethics  Hearing  Board  is  to  preserve  the  trust  placed  in  the  public  servants  of  the  City,  to 
promote public confidence in government, to protect the integrity of government decision making, and to enhance 
government efficiency.

Departmental/Bureau Overview
 
The Ethics Hearing Board comprises nine members with reputations of personal integrity and honesty.  Designed 
to be an impartial arm of government, seven of its nine members are selected by community organizations.  The 
Board’s staff includes an Executive Director.  

Those  served  by  the  Board  include  current,  former,  and  prospective  officials  and  employees  (including  those 
acting  under  contract),  consultants,  campaign  contributors,  and  persons  and  entities  who  do  or  seek  to  do 
business with the City, third parties involved with covered conduct, and those who give gifts to covered parties or 
their relatives. 

Advice  -  Ethics  advice  includes  researched  legal  opinions  which  serve  to  protect  the  requestor,  and  quick 
answers interpreting the law.  

Education  -  Internal  guidance,  policies  and  trainings;  and  external  information  for  the  public  to  build  trust  in 
government

Disclosures  -  There  are  eight  disclosures  staff  assists  with,  two  of  which  involve  an  approval:    Statement  of 
Financial  Interests,  Disclosure  of  Interests,  gift  disclosures,  conflict  of  interest  disclosures,  Statement  of 
Affiliations,  campaign  finance,  Valuable  Gift  Review  approving  gifts  offered  to  employees  over  $500,  and  an 
employment  approval  to  appoint,  hire,  advance,  or  advocate  for  a  family  member  based  on  qualifications,  the 
position’s responsibility, and the public interest.

Campaign  Finance  -  Includes  outreach,  management,  audits,  confirming  campaign  finance  contribution  limits 
and other requirements.

Compliance - Board staff responds to public complaints, conducts investigations, panel meetings, and hearings 
to  evaluate  alleged  misconduct,  and  takes  legal  action  and  additional  steps  as  required  to  collect  fines  and 
penalties.

Mission

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Office of Municipal Investigations (OMI) is responsible for coordinating the receipt, analysis, and investigation 
of citizen complaints of alleged misconduct by employees of the City of Pittsburgh.

OMI  investigates  and  helps  resolve  complaints  about  City  employees.  OMI  also  conducts  pre-employment 
background investigations on candidates for Public Safety jobs. The office is staffed by a civilian manager, civilian 
intake  and  operations  supervisor,  police  sergeant,  civilian  investigators,  sworn  police  detectives,  and  a  civilian 
fiscal coordinator.

OMI acts solely as a fact-finder and does not make disciplinary decisions or recommendations. OMI relies on City 
work rules, union contracts, civil service regulations, City code, and state laws to conduct analysis as to whether 
misconduct has occurred. It is OMI’s responsibility to ensure that all complaints receive fair, accurate, and timely 
investigations. By applying consistent and impartial evidential standards, as well as reliable and consistent case 
management  controls,  the  process  promotes  public  confidence  in  City  government  while  respecting  the  due 
process  rights  of  employees.    Written  policies  and  procedures  have  been  developed  that  ensure  uniform  and 
consistent investigations. 

OMI provides the following core services:

Allegations  of  Misconduct  -  OMI  conducts  investigations  when  there  are  allegations  of  misconduct  by  City  of 
Pittsburgh employees

Pre-Employment  Investigation  -  OMI  conducts  pre-employment  background  investigations  for  Public  Safety 
jobs and when otherwise requested

Residency Compliance - OMI conducts investigations when questions arise concerning City employee residency 
compliance

Policies  and  Procedures  -  Policy  development  and  improvement  addresses  two  areas:  1)  incorporating  best-
practice personnel models into the City’s policies and work culture; and 2) assessing the impact of City Council 
actions and management decisions on employees.

Training  and  Development  -  Education,  training,  and  development  services  increase  the  efficiency  and

fitness counseling, and other programs. CityFit emphasizes sustainable solutions based on rewards and results 
and uses web-based mobile technology with senior management endorsement.

Employee Safety and Injury Prevention - The Safety Office works to accomplish the following City objectives: 1) 
ensure  the  overall  safety  of  City  employees;  2)  prevent  job  related  injuries,  illnesses,  and  property  damage;  3) 
implement safety standards to prevent hazardous conditions and injuries; 4) train all employees in the safe and 
proper performance of their duties; 5) gain the active support and participation of all City employees in the pursuit 
of these objectives.

Workers’ Compensation - The Workers’ Compensation program ensures immediate and ongoing quality medical 
care to all City employees who are injured on-the-job and provides a program which meets the requirements of 
the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Bureau of Workers’ Compensation.

Payroll - The Payroll Office prepares, processes, audits, and distributes paychecks to the City's 3,400 employees.

Mission

The Department of City Planning establishes and sustains an orderly and consistent approach to land use in the 
City  of  Pittsburgh  that  incorporates  sustainability,  city  design,  resilience,  equity,  and  opportunity  in  its  work.   To 
achieve  this  end,  City  Planning  works  with  communities,  civic  organizations,  and  public  entities  to  develop 
policies, projects, and programs at the neighborhood and citywide scale and implements these policies through 
regulations,  public  commissions,  and  review  of  land  development  plans,  master  plans,  and  projects  for 
compliance with those policies and regulations.  The overriding goal is to sustain and enhance a thriving city of 
neighborhoods for the people who live, work, learn, and visit here.  Planning works to develop citywide strategies, 
rooted  in  principles  of  justice,  equity,  and  the  Just  Transition,  on  how  and  why  the  City  grows  and  changes 
through the Comprehensive Plan.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

Integrated Planning – A newly-created long-range division that focuses on topics related to an understanding of 
people’s  daily  lives  in  order  to  eliminate  inequities  among  Pittsburgh  residents  around  access  to  affordable 
housing,  transportation  options,  healthy  food  and  economic  opportunity,  and  food  and  transit  deserts.    Also 
focuses  on    the  perpetuation  of  the  proliferation  of  vacant  land  and  to  develop  new  pathways  to  create 
opportunities for residents.

Public History, Art, and Design – A division which ensures that art, culture, and history have a place in public 
spaces, and that the design of public spaces and civic structures has a positive impact on the City’s public realm. 
Our architecture, landmarks, historic districts, monuments, and artworks uplift community identity, public history, 
and  evolving  culture  in  Pittsburgh.  We  care  for  and  commission  the  physical  representations  of  the  stories  that 
comprise our public narrative.

Strategic Planning – A long-range division empowering communities to plan their future, providing a key link to 
city government and resources through development and implementation of the City’s Comprehensive Plan and 
Neighborhood Planning Program.

Sustainability & Resilience – A division which partners to protect and improve the environment for present and 
future  generations  by  imparting  leadership  for  the  integration  of  sustainability  and  resilience  into  the  City’s 
operations,  policies,  and  investments,  and  implementation  of  Pittsburgh’s  climate  planning  and  resilience 
strategies.
 
Zoning & Development Review – A division that staffs the Planning Commission, Zoning Board of Adjustment, 
and  Contextual  Design Advisory  Panel  with  a  focus  on  implementing  the  vision  and  plans  for  the  City  and  its 
neighborhoods through administration of the City’s Zoning Code.

Mission

The  mission  of  the  Department  of  Public  Safety  is  to  provide  for  the  security  and  safety  of  all  residents  and 
patrons  of  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  through  the  oversight  and  execution  of  the  public  safety  operational  strategies 
through  the  planned  and  coordinated  efforts  of  the  Bureaus  of  Police  (PBP),  Fire  (PBF),  Emergency  Medical 
Services (EMS), and Animal Care and Control (ACC). This mission includes the creation of a command team with 
representatives from PBP, PBF, and EMS acting in conjunction as the Office of Emergency Management (OEM). 
We strive to improve community and first responder safety through integrated response, training, technology, fleet 
upgrades,  and  increased  community  visibility  as  well  as  enhancing  and  enforcing  team  collaboration  across  all 
Public Safety Bureaus. We attempt to further our mission through the streamlining of administrative positions to 
provide cross training support, and improve oversight on resources, spending, and hiring practices.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

Administration  -  The  Bureau  of Administration  contains  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  the  Department  of  Public 
Safety. It is a managed entity responsible for standardizing practices, policies, response efforts, technology, and 
communication between all bureaus. It provides oversight and inter-bureau coordination of personnel, resources, 
facilities, and finances. While each of the bureaus remain independent, the Department has streamlined uniform 
policies, reporting structures, and financial management.

Community Outreach - The Office of Community Outreach serves as a liaison between the City of Pittsburgh’s 
residents  and  community  groups  and  the  Department  of  Public  Safety.  The  Community  Outreach  staff  is 
responsible for coordinating and maintaining numerous Public Safety community relations initiatives. In an effort 
to keep residents safe and improve their quality of life, the Outreach staff educates and provides the public with 
general  safety,  crime  prevention,  and  various  life  enhancing  resources. These  initiatives  are  conducted  through 
meetings, workshops, and community sponsored events. The Department of Public Safety Community Outreach 
efforts can be classified into four categories - Safer Together Pittsburgh, Youth Policy, Victim Assistance, and the 
Ranger program.
 

Through  its  growing  partnerships  with  residents,  local  businesses,  and  community  organizations,  Safer 
Together Pittsburgh strives to build and maintain strong communicative relationships between the City of 
Pittsburgh’s  Public  Safety  Bureaus  and  City  of  Pittsburgh  residents.  The  Public  Safety  Zone  Councils 
continue to be an instrumental tool in the success of the Safer Together Pittsburgh Outreach initiatives. 
This  relationship  affords  the  Department  of  Public  Safety  the  opportunity  to  closely  assess  the  safety 
needs  and  concerns  of  residents.  In  addition,  this  relationship  allows  the  department  to  better  utilize  its 
resources to meet the needs and service expectations of underserved communities and populations.

  

Youth Policy programs are designed to identify the safety needs of children and youth. Programming is 
structured  to  nurture  healthy  relationships  between  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  youth  and  Public  Safety 
personnel. In conjunction with the services of the Public Safety Bureaus, a combination of City, County, 
and State resources are utilized to ensure that the safety requirements of this vulnerable population are 
fulfilled.
 
Victim Assistance provides information and support to City residents and families that are victims of crime 
and  natural  or  man-made  disasters.  A  Victim  Assistance  Coordinator  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that 
victims of crimes investigated by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, or national or man-made disaster are 
afforded the opportunity to receive services and support for long-term safety needs as permissible by law. 
This  position  coordinates  the  day-to-day  operational  aspects  as  well  as  works  with  law  enforcement  on 
training  and  maintaining  community  awareness  of  services  available  to  victims  of  crime  and  natural  or 
man-made disasters, and liaises with City and County agencies to ensure coordinated services.
 
The Park Ranger Program is a vital connection between the City of Pittsburgh’s parks and its park users. 
Park  Rangers  act  as  park  ambassadors  for  the  Department  of  Public  Safety  by  educating  park  visitors/
users on park offerings, programs, activities, local ordinances, rules, and regulations. Park Rangers also 
engage  park  visitors  in  mutually  respectful  ways  that  benefit  and  develop  relationships  and  appropriate 
park use.

Nighttime Economy - Nighttime Economy supports the food, beverage and entertainment events that enhance 
Pittsburgh’s  quality  of  life  and  attractiveness  to  visitors  and  relocating  companies.  However  this  industry  can 
present unique potential public safety risks and quality of life impacts. Further, consumer demand is forceful and 
trends  populate  quickly,  often  well  in  advance  of  policies  that  could  address  issues.  Responsible  Hospitality 
includes  planning,  monitoring,  managing,  and  policing.  The  Nighttime  Economy  Coordinator  facilitates  these 
activities  and  upholds  Sociable  City  Pittsburgh’s  vision:  “Safe  and  vibrant  places  to  socialize  for  visitors  and 
Pittsburghers of all ages, cultures and lifestyles” and the Sociable City's mission: “Retain and grow the economic 
value  of  the  social  and  nighttime  economy  while  effectively  preventing  and  addressing  nuisance  activities, 
managing  public  safety  risks  and  alleviating  quality  of  life  impacts.”  The  Nighttime  Economy  Coordinator  is 
additionally charged with implementing the long range recommendations from the Sociable City Plan, as well as 
facilitating key stakeholders to guide policy changes and resource allocation to support and sustain Pittsburgh’s 
nighttime economy.

Group  Violence  Intervention  Initiative  -  Group  Violence  Intervention  (GVI)  plays  a  crucial  role  in  reducing 
neighborhood violence. It is partnership between law enforcement, street outreach workers, social services and 
the community who mediates and interrupts violence from spreading.

Office  of  Emergency  Management  -  The  Office  of  Emergency  Management  (OEM)  works  to  reduce  the 
vulnerability  of  the  populace  and  property  of  the  City  to  injury  and  loss  resulting  from  natural  or  man-made 
disasters.  This  office  also  provides  prompt  and  efficient  rescue,  care,  and  treatment  of  persons  threatened  or 
victimized by disaster; provides for rapid and orderly restoration and recovery following disasters; and educates 
the public regarding their responsibilities in responding to disasters affecting the City of Pittsburgh. Comprised of 
representatives  from  PBP,  PBF,  and  EMS,  with  oversight  by  the  Director’s  office,  the  restructured  OEM  works 
together with other departments to formulate strategies and policies for planned events, and potential natural and 
man-made events utilizing the National Incident Management System.

Office  of  Film  &  Event  Management  -  The  newly  organized  Office  of  Film  &  Event  Management  is  currently 
comprised  of  two  full-time  staff  who  are  tasked  with  receiving  and  vetting  applications  for  small  and  large-scale 
events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh. It is responsible for consulting with both film and event 
permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met, as 
well  as  working  with  all  City  departments  to  ensure  proper  planning,  coordination,  and  execution  of  events  and 
film  projects.  Additionally,  it  will  ensure  that  events  and  film  productions  do  not  negatively  impact  the  City’s 
operations  and  remain  positive  assets  to  the  City  and  its  residents.  Lastly,  this  office  chairs  the  Special  Events 
Committee and assists in the safe and effective planning of large scale City-wide events.

Public Information Office/Media - The Public Information Office budget includes four full-time employees: One 
Public Information Officer, one Deputy Public Information Officer, one Assistant Public Information Officer, and one 
Social  Media  Specialist.  The  PIO  Office’s  mission  is  to  tell  the  whole  story  of  Public  Safety,  not  just  what  the 
media covers, and to foster a collaborative environment between Public Safety and the public by promoting and 
practicing  transparency.  The  PIO’s  Office  provides  information  to  the  public,  primarily  through  social  media  but 
also through traditional media, on behalf of all Public Safety departments. 

Public  Safety  Technology  -  The  Office  of  Public  Safety  Technology  coordinates  closely  with  the  City's 
Department  of  Innovation  &  Performance,  bureau  technology  subject  matter  experts,  other  departments  and 
partner  agencies  to  enhance  safety  and  awareness  of  Public  Safety  personnel  by  assessing  both  existing  and 
new  technology,  infrastructure,  and  solutions  utilized  by  responders  in  their  daily  activities.    The  Public  Safety 
Technology Manager ensures critical public safety technology and systems function efficiently and effectively on a 
24/7 basis including citywide security camera deployment, the gunshot detection system, radio communications, 
and Public Safety-specific software. The Manager works closely with outside entities to allow all bureaus to have 
the  technical  resources  necessary  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  residents,  visitors,  and  employees  of  the  City  of 
Pittsburgh.

Special  Inter-Bureau  Operations  -  Special  Inter-Bureau  Operations  includes  emergency  response  requiring 
personnel, equipment, and resources from EMS, Fire, Police, Emergency Management, Animal Care and Control, 
and  the  Rangers.  These  operations  include  on-going  operational  training,  readiness,  planning,  and  provide

resources to incidents such as hazardous material release, active shooter events, flood response, high rise fires, 
and terrorist attacks.

Public  Safety  Facilities  -    The  Office  of  Public  Safety  Facilities  coordinates  closely  with  the  Director  of  the 
Department  of  Public  Safety,  the  various  Bureau  Chiefs  within  the  Department,  and  the  Department  of  Public 
Works  regarding  Public  Safety  facilities.  The  Office  ensures  that  systems  and  chains-of-communications  are  in 
place  to  support  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  Department  of  Public  Safety.  The  Office  manages  or  leads  all 
facility  work  flow,  including  work  order  processing/follow-up,  working  with  the  Department  of  Public  Works  to

management, and risk management agencies. The Office also has the additional duties of City-County Building

Mission

The  Bureau  of  Emergency  Medical  Services  (EMS)  is  dedicated  to  the  reduction  of  morbidity  and  mortality  of 
residents  and  visitors  through  the  provision  of  Advanced  and  Basic  Life  Support  pre-hospital  care,  medically 
directed rescue, and transportation of the ill and injured.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Bureau of EMS provides advanced life support, pre-hospital care, and transportation for the sick and injured 
through the deployment of thirteen advanced life support ambulances, each staffed by Pennsylvania Department 
of Health Certified Paramedics. In addition to the advanced life support units the bureau also staffs four basic life 
support  ambulances  staffed  by  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Health  Certified  Emergency  Medical  Technicians. 
Strategically located throughout the City, the Bureau will operate thirteen advanced life support (ALS) and three 
basic life support (BLS) ambulances 24 hours per day when at full staffing capacity.
 
With  advanced  training  and  technology,  the  Bureau  of  EMS  is  delivering  cutting-edge  care  by  providing  new 
treatment  modalities  that  allow  for  more  effective  recognition  and  treatment  of  heart  attacks,  strokes,  cardiac 
arrest,  and  a  number  of  other  life  threatening  conditions.  For  patients  experiencing  ST  Elevation  Myocardial 
Infarction  (STEMI),  EMS  has  the  ability  to  screen  and  directly  transmit  an  EKG  to  the  receiving  hospital  and 
activate the cardiac cauterization laboratory prior to arrival, greatly reducing the time to definitive treatment.

The Bureau of EMS also provides integrated medically-directed rescue for vehicle accidents, industrial accidents, 
high  and  low  angle  rope  rescues,  confined  space  emergencies,  building  collapse,  elevator  emergencies,  and 
others. The base service is comprised of two specially equipped rescue trucks, each staffed by two paramedics, 
operating  24  hours  a  day.  All  Pittsburgh  Paramedics  are  trained  and  certified  for  vehicle  and  basic  rescue 
practices. Those paramedics assigned to the Rescue Division receive additional rescue training and certifications.  

The  Bureau  of  EMS  is  also  an  integral  part  of  three  joint  public  safety  teams:  River  Rescue,  SWAT,  and  the 
Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Team. For each team, EMS provides an administrative and leadership role as well 
as a cadre of highly qualified personnel and instructors. 

For  River  Rescue,  EMS  provides  two  Paramedic  Public  Safety  SCUBA  divers  to  staff  the  units.  The  Bureau  of 
Police assigns an officer/helmsman who provides a law enforcement component to the units. This unit conducts 
port security and safety patrols on a routine basis. 

For  the  SWAT  Team,  EMS  provides  trained  Tactical  EMS  (TEMS)  personnel  who  have  undergone  all  of  the 
required  SWAT  training  in  addition  to  specialized  treatment  under  fire  training.  They  respond  as  an  integral 
element  of  the  SWAT  Team  to  multiple  incidents  such  as  barricaded  persons,  high  risk  warrants,  and  dignitary 
protection.

For  the  Hazmat  Team,  EMS  participates  with  the  Bureaus  of  Fire  and  Police,  providing  personnel  trained  and 
certified  to  the  Technician  level  for  entry,  evaluation,  mitigation,  and  decontamination.  EMS  also  provides  the 
required medical monitoring for pre-entry and post-entry for an incident.

The Bureau of Emergency Medical Services also provides the following services to the community:

•

Special Event coverage (Heinz Field, PNC Park, PPG Paints Arena, etc.) averages 90 events per month 
using ambulances, EMS motorcycles, bicycles, boats, and medical carts

Mission

 Bureau of Fire
 250000

It is the mission of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire (PBF) to protect life, property, and the environment by providing 
effective  customer  and  human  services  related  to  fire  suppression,  emergency  medical  services,  hazard 
mitigation, emergency management services, and domestic preparedness.

The  Pittsburgh  Bureau  of  Fire  encourages  all  personnel  to  take  a  proactive  role  in  reducing  the  impact  from 
emergencies  by  providing  programs  related  to  fire  prevention,  public  education,  community  relations,  risk 
reduction,  disaster  planning,  homeland  security,  and  operational  training. All  services  provided  to  the  residents 
and  visitors  of  the  City  of  Pittsburgh,  the  County  of Allegheny,  and  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  will  be 
delivered in the most professional manner, to the best of our ability.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Pittsburgh  Bureau  of  Fire  as  related  to  public  safety  include  emergency 
medical  care,  fire  investigation,  code  enforcement,  training,  logistics,  and  suppression.  Suppression  and 
emergency  medical  services  are  the  largest  functional  area  in  terms  of  responsibility  and  resources.  The 
suppression function is the activity of containing and extinguishing a fire. The goals of the suppression division are 
to protect lives, property and the environment. The PBF expanded its emergency medical service capabilities by 
becoming  a  licensed  emergency  medical  care  provider  issued  by  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Health.  The 
Bureau provides these services through the following four divisions:

Administration - Provides managerial and administrative services for the Bureau.  This activity includes budget 
and  finance;  payroll;  employee  relations,  strategic  planning;  record  and  data  gathering,  facility  and  fleet 
management.

Operations  -  Provides  emergency  incident  response  to  protect  the  lives  and  property  of  city  residents  and 
visitors. In addition to extinguishing fires, controlling hazardous material emergency incidents, flood response, and 
emergency management, the personnel in this service area are responsible for providing emergency medical care 
to sick and injured individuals. The Fire Bureau responds to approximately 20,000 emergency medical calls each 
year. 

Planning  and  Training  -  Provides  training,  communications,  and  logistics  for  the  Bureau  of  Fire.  The  Training 
Academy implements employee development programs for fire suppression personnel. The programs consist of 
fire  suppression,  apparatus  driving  operations,  emergency  medical  responder,  hazardous  material,  technical 
rescue,  vehicle  rescue,  and  disaster  response  topics. The  PBF  expanded  its  role  in  disaster  preparedness  and 
response, which includes increased capabilities to provide swift-water rescue, as well as taking a proactive role in 
planning and preparation for a disaster involving crude oil being transported by rail through the City of Pittsburgh, 
and  other  transportation  emergencies. All  new  recruits  must  complete  32  weeks  of  basic  training  before  being 
assigned to a permanent station within the PBF. In addition to recruit training, continuing education is required for 
all members of the PBF. The Bureau also provides public education to various community organizations and City 
programs such as the Civic Leadership Academy.

Risk  Management  -  Enforces  the  City’s  hazardous  material  code,  the  International  Fire  Code,  investigates 
complaints of life-threatening and unsafe conditions, and conducts fire investigations. It is also responsible for the 
health and safety of Bureau employees through preventive and corrective measures.

Mission
 
The mission of the Office of Community Health and Safety is to  improve community safety and well-being, and 
support public safety personnel by building a public health-informed response continuum. 

Departmental/Bureau Overview 

The  Office  of  Community  Health  and  Safety  is  focused  on  building  a  response  continuum  and  developing 
sustainable  upstream  interventions  to  address  unmet  community  social  service  needs  that  often  fall  to  Public 
Safety personnel, who represent the 24/7 safety net response.  Through partnerships and program development, 
the Office will focus on:

Developing  a  Continuum  of  Support:    Through  continued  collaboration  with  first  responders  and  community 
members,  analysis  of  calls  for  service,  mapping  of  existing  services,  development  of  new  partnerships,  and 
evaluation  of  existing  models,  the  Office  of  Community  Health  &  Safety  (OCH&S)  will  establish  a  continuum  of 
resources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public 
Safety partners.  First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis 
will be utilized to build this continuum.

Implementation  of  Public  Health-Informed  Practices:    Public  Safety  personnel  consistently  respond  to 
community  needs  that  exceed  what  they  can  provide  in  a  single  engagement  model;  however,  first  responders 
have significant exposure to issues that affect community members’ health and well-being.  OCH&S will work with 
the  Department  of  Public  Safety,  public  health  entities,  and  academic  partners  to  evaluate  new  programs  and 
responses  to  proactively  address  issues  (especially  upstream  interventions)  and  reduce  harm  experienced  by 
community  members.    Additionally,  partners  will  evaluate  best  practices,  facilitate  focus  groups,  and  elevate 
translational experiences.

Consistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and 
accountability  to  the  community  and  first  responders  is  critical  to  building  trust  and  facilitating  change  in  the 
current response continuum.  OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, 
prioritizing  continuous  review  to  ensure  that  deficits  are  quickly  addressed  and  used  for  growth.    OCH&S  will 
partner  with  existing  community  organizations  and  prioritize  community  members  who  have  been  harmed  and 
may  not  engage  in  traditional  meetings.    Initial  efforts  will  focus  on  creation  of  multiple  advisory  collaboratives 
focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism.

Note: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.

2023 Accomplishments

•

•

•

•

•

Launch of Co-Response in 2023 in Police Zones 1 & 2, which includes Downtown Pittsburgh. In the last 
month alone, the team has successfully prevented 3 jumpers from reaching completion. It also played an 
integral role in resolving a 90+ person migrant crisis at the Greyhound. In total, it has seen 107 patients 
served, 307 service encounters, and 143 reasons for referral since April 2023. 
Launch  of  the  Trauma  Survivors  Assistance  Program  this  summer,  with  already  achieving  over  700 
encounters and providing support to the community during and after the Garfield shooting. 
The Office of Community Health & Safety launched a Downtown Crisis Response Case Conference with 
DHS Leadership, outreach organizations, and OCHS Leadership to best address the most complex cases 
affecting downtown. The target audience are individuals who are in crisis, experience homelessness and 
extreme poverty, and have high engagement with law enforcement and the criminal/legal system. 
Secured  $1  million  in  federal  funding  to  launch  Post  Overdose  Support Teams  (POST)  next  year  which 
will  perform  secondary  response  to  individuals  who  refuse  medical  treatment  after  experiencing  an 
overdose. The team will consist of certified peer recovery specialists and case managers. The response 
will  foster  a  connection  that  places  the  individual  in  a  deescalated  state  following  the  overdose  and 
provide social and service supports to prevent future overdoses 
The Community Partnership Specialist ensures that the diversity of experiences, perspectives, and needs 
remains at the forefront of each program. To date we have: Distributed over 1,000 Narcan, 500 fentanyl 
test strips, 820 gun safety locks, 300 CPR face shields and attended and tabled 6 harm reduction fairs in 
the City in collaboration with the Allegheny County Health Department. Additionally, we have participated 
in  4  City  in  the  Streets  and  organized  International  Overdose  Awareness  Day,  with  over  35  providers 
tabled at event

Administration  division  is  to  coordinate  with  other  City  departments,  the  Office  of  the  Mayor,  City  Council,  and 
external partners to ensure effective, efficient, and impactful delivery of programs to the public.  

Our four core program areas include:  

Recreation Programs – The Recreation Programs division is committed to providing opportunities for residents 
and nonresidents of all ages to participate in directed recreational, educational, and enrichment-focused programs 
and activities. This area includes the operation of our recreation centers and fitness gyms, organized Citisports/ 
sports programming, activities at the Schenley Ice Rink and Mellon Tennis Center, and the implementation of 
summer and after-school youth camps and programs. The recreation system has a specific focus on providing 
services to families and opportunities for Pittsburgh’s youth to have a safe and enriching place during out of 
school time hours.  

Senior and Wellness Programs – Citiparks operates thirteen Healthy Active Living Centers which are focused 
on improving the physical, intellectual, social, cultural, and financial health and interests of older residents. The 
senior program partners with other area agencies in delivering quality health and wellness programs, and works to 
address the needs of individuals as they age. In addition, this division oversees the City of Pittsburgh’s 
commitment to nutrition support for city residents through the management of food programs for youth and older 
adults, the City’s Farmers Markets, City Farms, and the newly created Pittsburgh Food Justice Fund.  

Community Programs – Community programs and events are focused on activating our park and recreation 
spaces to engage city residents in a whole host of enriching experiences. Our office of Special Events is charged 
with hosting movies, music, races, and other key city events including the 4th of July and Light Up Night.  Our 
Community Enrichment team operates the Roving Art Cart, participates in special recreational programs, partners 
with PPS Schools, and organizes and plans annual premier celebrations like Alphabet Trail & Tales and Track n' 
Treat. A  specific focus of this program area is the Rec2Tech initiative. This program focuses on the development 
and delivery of technology focused programs, coding, and other tech-adjacent learning initiatives. 

Aquatics Programs – The aquatics division is responsible for providing city residents with access to safe pools 
and aquatic activity year-round. The aquatics division operates 18 City of Pittsburgh pools and 9 spray parks 
during the summer months. In the off season the aquatics team operates the Oliver Bath House, scheduled to 
complete renovation in fall of 2024, and partners with Pittsburgh Public Schools to host swim opportunities and 
lifeguard trainings for Pittsburgh youth that may be interesting in becoming a part of the City’s aquatics team. In 
addition to staffing the pools for open swim, the aquatics team offers learn to swim, water aerobics, and swim 
team programming throughout the summer months.

Mission

The  mission  of  the  Department  of  Mobility  and  Infrastructure  is  to  provide  the  physical  mobility  necessary  to 
enable  the  social  and  economic  mobility  of  the  people  of  Pittsburgh  through  the  management,  design, 
improvement and operation of the public rights of way.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The  Department  of  Mobility  and  Infrastructure  is  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  transportation  and  city-provided 
mobility services, including:

Planning transportation and mobility systems, corridors, and network operations

•
• Managing the flow of infrastructure funding
•
Developing policies to guide the use of public right-of-ways and management of transportation systems
• Managing the public right-of-way to ensure continued safe, efficient and productive use that respects and 

implements city policies and public priorities
Designing, operating and maintaining the transportation system for safe and efficient mobility of all modes 
to sustain and grow a vital, thriving, and equitable Pittsburgh
Designing and implementing street and other infrastructure improvements in collaboration with community 
and public stakeholders

• Measuring and monitoring mobility performance with the goal of continuous learning and improvement

The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is comprised of three bureaus:

Planning, Policy and Permitting - The Planning, Policy and Permitting Bureau is led by the Assistant Director 
and establishes the comprehensive vision, guiding policies and permitted uses of the urban mobility network and 
public rights of way. It is comprised of three divisions:

Planning  -  Oversees  development  of  system  plans  and  multimodal  networks  and  collaborates  on 
implementation; develops conceptual design of transportation facilities; gathers and analyzes data on the 
condition and use of the mobility system; coordinates with county and regional organizations and entities 
to plan transportation infrastructure improvements and mobility systems; and serves as the initial point of 
contact  for  public  stakeholders  and  partners  for  general  mobility  concerns  or  initiatives. Additionally,  the 
planning  division  tracks  development  of  the  regional  Transportation  Improvement  Program  (TIP), 
development of the department’s submission to the city’s Capital Improvement Plan, and pursuit of grants 
and other resources to support implementation of the transportation program.

Policy - Develops, communicates and maintains policies for the use, management, design and oversight 
of  public  mobility  services,  transportation  facilities  and  public  rights  of  way;  manages  demand  on  the 
mobility system; and develops and maintains guidelines, standards, and processes for the use of public 
rights of way and the operation of the system and mobility services.

Permitting,  Inspections  and  ROW  Coordination  -  Issues  permits  for  use  of  or  activities  in  the  public 
rights  of  way  in  compliance  with  regulations  and  established  policies;  coordinates  current  and  future 
activities with public and private utilities occupying the public rights of way; and enforces right of way use 
to ensure all activities in the public right of way are in compliance with established rules and regulations 
and  the  Pittsburgh  Code  via  the  inspection  process.  The  Permit  Division  coordinates  the  activities  of 
utilities  in  the  public  right  of  way  to  minimize  disruption  and  optimize  opportunities  for  cooperative 
improvements.

Traffic  Operations  -  The  Traffic  Operations  Bureau  is  led  by  the  Municipal  Traffic  Engineer  and  oversees  the 
operation of the overall transportation and mobility network. The Bureau includes four divisions:

Traffic  Design  Division  -  The  Design  Division  develops  design  standards  and  guidelines  for 
transportation facilities including travel way dimensions, assemblage, operation, markings, signage, and 
other components. The Division is central in the determining design of facilities for vehicles, bicycles and

pedestrians.  It  provides  programmatic  guidance  for  complete  street,  safe  routes  to  school  and  traffic 
calming improvements.

Signal  Design  Division  –  The  Signal  Division  is  responsible  for  designing  the  programming  and 
operational plans for more than 600 signalized intersections throughout the city and designing plans for 
other  devices  such  as  school  zone  signs,  rapid  flash  beacons,  variable  signs,  and  other  elements. The 
Design  Division  assists  the  Planning  Bureau  in  reviewing  land  development  projects  and  specifically 
evaluating transportation impacts and necessary mitigations.

Signs  and  Markings  Division  -  The  Signs  and  Markings  Division  fabricates,  installs,  repairs  and/or 
replaces  pavement  markings,  and  signage.  It  is  responsible  for  striping  more  than  2,000  miles  of  long 
markings,  10,000  marked  crosswalks,  and  850  traffic  control  and  curbside  regulatory  signs.  The  Signs 
and Markings Division is typically responsible for the implementation of designs generated by the Design 
Division.

Traffic Control Division - The Traffic Control Division performs necessary and routine maintenance on 
more than 10,000 traffic signal heads and other electronic traffic control devices across the City to keep 
them in operation.

Project Design and Delivery - The Project Design and Delivery Bureau is led by the Chief Engineer. The Bureau 
is  responsible  for  all  of  the  major  capital  improvement  projects  for  transportation  or  mobility  infrastructure.  This 
includes not only street and bridge work, but also providing engineering services to address major slope failure 
and flood control needs in the city. The Bureau is comprised of three divisions:

Engineering  Design  Division  -  The  Engineering  Design  Division  completes  preliminary  and  final 
engineering for complex public infrastructure projects and oversees the construction services provided by 
City  contractors. The  Division  supports  the  Permit  Division  through  review  of  restoration  or  alteration  of 
the  public  right  of  way  carried  out  by  private  developments.  Project  Managers  develop  and  maintain 
standards  and  specifications  for  construction  in  the  public  right  of  way;  and  inspect  the  condition  of 
structures in the public right of way to ensure the safety of the traveling public.

Paving Division - The Paving Division oversees City resurfacing projects on public streets, trail facilities 
and  other  public  paved  surfaces  and  the  improvement  of  sidewalk  ramps  affected  by  this  work.  The 
Division is responsible for resurfacing more than 60 miles of streets every year in the city.

Construction  Division  -  The  Construction  Division  of  the  Department  of  Mobility  and  Infrastructure 
addresses immediate needs for typically smaller scale improvements of infrastructure in the public rights 
of way. The Division oversees work to repair, replace or rehabilitate curbs, sidewalks, curb ramps, steps, 
walls, slopes and other similar projects. Division managers respond to emergency events that disrupt the 
safe operation of the mobility system such as landslides, sink holes, and bridge strikes.

The three Bureaus of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure are collectively responsible for:

1,060 linear miles of streets (890 asphalt, 90 concrete, 80 brick/block stone)
2,423 lane miles of streets (2,034 asphalt, 206 concrete, 183 brick/block stone)
Tens of thousands of crosswalks and pavement markings
675 sets of steps covering 23.3 lineal miles
44,000 street lighting fixtures
660 signalized intersections
850,000 street signs
33 miles of guide rail

DOMI-Permits Policy & Planning - The Complete Streets Advisory Group (CSAG) was reconvened after a 
nearly  4  year  hiatus!  CSAG  is  comprised  of  government  officials,  advocates,  technical  experts,  and 
citizens that are passionate about safety, equity and accessibility of city streets. The group will advise the 
Department  in  the  creation  of  policy  and  procedures  to  further  the  goals  of  the  City's  Complete  Streets 
Policy 
DOMI Projects Design & Delivery Division has increased staffing to better manage our bridge inventory.  
We  have  quadrupled  spending  on  bridge  maintenance  and  repairs  in  the  last  12  months  versus  the 
previous 4 years
DOMI-Traffic  Division  has  continually  evolved  our  team  and  program  to  better  respond  to  constituent 
needs this year by:
Installing new treatments to protect bike lanes (jersey barrier and precast concrete blocks)
Launching an interactive GIS-based traffic calming portal
Training new staff to take on more “Short term” projects

Citizen Police Review Board

Mission

The  Independent  Citizen  Police  Review  Board  ("CPRB")  promotes  responsible  citizenship  and  respectable  law 
enforcement through mutual accountability.  The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide 
independent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  To accomplish this assignment, the Board 
will  thoroughly  investigate  specific  allegations  of  misconduct,  hold  public  hearings  to  examine  such  allegations; 
evaluate  current  police  procedures  and  promote  safe,  professional  and  effective  law  enforcement  practices 
through public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor 
and Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.

A  Board  comprised  of  seven  members  appointed  by  the  Mayor  and  City  Council  presides  over  the  work  of  the 
staff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and 
recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

Investigation and Complaint Disposition - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the 
CPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake 
Coordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of 
the complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the 
complaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a 
preliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides 
daily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and 
the results are presented to the Board.  The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an 
investigation  into  the  allegations  of  misconduct  or  to  dismiss  the  complaint.  Complaints  may  proceed  through 
investigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion.  Findings and recommendations resulting from public 
hearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board.  Patterns emerging from 
complaints  and  allegations  of  misconduct  may  be  presented  to  the  Board  for  consideration  of  policy 
recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.

Community Education - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens 
and  police  by  developing  or  enhancing  common  knowledge  of  police  authority,  practices  and  procedures,  and 
civilian  expectations  of  police  conduct.    Outreach  utilizes  printed  material,  traditional  and  social  media,  and 
personal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s 
role  and  common  rights  and  responsibilities  of  citizenship.    The  effort  directed  to  citizens  (1)  ensures  that  the 
public is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen 
and  the  officer,  and  (2)  conveys  information  on  filing  complaints  when  such  encounters  are  perceived  as 
offensive.    The  outreach  to  police  officers  is  designed  to  encourage  participation  in  investigations,  explain  the 
process, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.

Board  and  Staff  Development  -  Training  for  Members  encompasses  topics  mandated  by  City  Ordinance, 
including  police  training,  police  policies  and  procedures,  criminal,  civil  and  constitutional  law  as  well  as  human 
rights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior.  Staff training 
is designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops 
mediation  and  conciliation  skills  as  well  as  crisis  management  and  safety  skills.  Staff  adheres  to  the  standards 
and performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.

Administrative - The Executive Director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the Board 
and those of the City which affect the daily operation of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board.  Activities 
of  this  core  service  include  the  planning,  organization,  development,  evaluation,  and  implementation  of  efficient 
and effective management strategies of fiscal, personnel, information systems, and related support to maximize 
the  utility  of  the  resources  available.  The  Assistant  Executive  Director  facilitates  daily  administrative 
communication and serves as liaison to the administrative departments of the City.

Grants Office

 Grants

The City of Pittsburgh’s Grants Office is situated within the Office of Management and Budget and is tasked with 
centralizing  the  City’s  grant-seeking  efforts  as  well  as  providing  guidance  and  oversight  to  City  departments  in 
managing their post-award grant administration and reporting processes.

The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City’s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate, 
and  foundation  grants  and  to  effectively  assist  in  the  full  life-cycle  of  grant  management  from  award  through 
closeout. The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City’s exposure to any grant-related legal liability, 
and improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.

The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to 
expand  its  overall  capacity  without  placing  greater  burden  on  the  City’s  Operating  and  Capital  budgets.  Grant 
funds  received  by  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  support  important  programs  and  services  that  the  City  provides  to  our 
community.  These  funds  allow  the  City  to  extend  pre-existing  services,  introduce  new  initiatives,  gain 
technological  advances,  and  subsidize  programmatic  staffing  and  equipment.  Grant  funds  are  dispersed 
throughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services, 
recreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows 
the City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the 
impact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.

In 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. Some projects 
supported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding 
to rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield 
Bridge supported by a State grant award..
