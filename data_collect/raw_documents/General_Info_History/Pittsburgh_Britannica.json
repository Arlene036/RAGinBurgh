                "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Davante Adams will likely make his debut for the New York Jets on Sunday night at Pittsburgh.",
                "The star wide receiver was acquired from Las Vegas on Tuesday and interim Jets coach Jeff Ulbrich said Wednesday that Adams would participate in the team's walkthrough and should play against the Steelers.",
                "“I think so,” Ulbrich said. “Yep.”",
                "Adams missed the Raiders' past three games with a hamstring injury that coincided with his request to be traded. While making a surprise appearance during quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ weekly spot on “The Pat McAfee Show” on Tuesday, Adams said he was expecting to play.",
                "“I’m feeling great, man,” Adams said. “Fortunately, I’ll be able to roll.”",
                "That means he and Rodgers will immediately renew their on-field connection, which was one of the greatest quarterback-wide receivers in recent NFL history. Adams caught 615 passes from Rodgers for 7,517 yards and 68 touchdowns during eight seasons together in Green Bay. That’s the most in all three categories between any combination of active players.",
                "The 31-year-old Adams caught 103 passes last season for 1,144 yards and eight touchdowns for the Raiders. It was his fifth 1,000-yard season in six years, broken up only by the 997 yards he had in 2019.",
                "Adams caught 18 passes for 209 yards and a touchdown in three games with Las Vegas this season.",
                "He'll join a suddenly crowded Jets wide receivers group that includes Garrett Wilson, who leads New York with 41 receptions, Allen Lazard, Mike Williams, Xavier Gipson, Irvin Charles and rookie Malachi Corley. There are some questions as to how new offensive play caller Todd Downing will be able to find roles for everyone while also integrating Adams into the system.",
                "“It's a really cool problem to have,” Ulbrich said. “It's going to give us an opportunity to have more flexibility where we move these guys around. Sometimes it'll be based upon the route concepts, sometimes the matchups, but it gives us a lot of freedom to play around with where these guys line (up).”",
                "Williams, a free agent signing last offseason, has been slow to develop a rapport with Rodgers. He was the intended receiver when Rodgers threw interceptions on the Jets' last offensive series in losses to Buffalo and Minnesota. Rodgers said Williams was in the wrong spot on the throw that was picked off by Taron Johnson on Monday night.",
                "Adams' arrival, in particular, clouds Williams' role in the offense.",
                "“Talked to Todd about it yesterday and this morning, and fortunately, Todd is very good at marking the plays for certain guys and making sure that everybody has a part of this offense,” Ulbrich said. “So, Todd is on it. Every guy will be integrated and every guy will get his touches and his (opportunities) and every guy will be featured, at times.”",
                "Ulbrich said Rodgers was sitting out the walkthrough Wednesday while resting his banged-up left ankle. The 40-year-old quarterback was limited during the team's first two practices last week before fully participating last Saturday. Ulbrich said Rodgers should practice Thursday and be fine to play Sunday.",

                "PITTSBURGH (AP) — Russell Wilson's time may be fast approaching in Pittsburgh.",
                "Coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that Wilson is “in consideration” to be the starting quarterback when the Steelers (4-2) host the New York Jets (2-4) on Sunday night. The 35-year-old nine-time Pro Bowler has spent the past six weeks recovering from a calf injury he aggravated a couple of days before the season opener.",
                "While Tomlin stressed that Justin Fields \"has been really good\" while filling in for Wilson and the team has “been really good at times,” the NFL's longest-tenured coach added that good was “not to be confused with great.\"",
                "Enter Wilson, who won the starting job at the end of training camp before tweaking the calf less than 72 hours before a Week 1 visit to Atlanta. Tomlin saw enough of Wilson in practice last week to have him serve as the backup behind Fields during a 32-13 win in Las Vegas, and there's a very real chance they could swap roles against the Jets.",
                "“This is a competitive league, man,” Tomlin said. “We’re trying to position ourselves to be that team. And we got a player with talent who hadn’t had an opportunity to play. So we’re going to potentially explore those things.”",
                "Fields has been efficient and occasionally spectacular during his six-week audition. He's also largely avoided the kinds of mistakes that were a common thread during his three years in Chicago, throwing just one interception in 160 attempts. His accuracy, however, had dipped of late. Fields has completed just 57% (29 of 51) of his passes over his past eight quarters, down from 69% (77 of 111) across the opening month of the season.",
                "The Steelers are also 28th in passing and 20th in scoring, riding a soft(ish) early season schedule and a disruptive defense led by All-Pro linebacker T.J. Watt to a tie atop the AFC North with rival Baltimore. After a pair of home primetime games against the New York City area teams — the Jets on Sunday, the Giants on Oct. 28 — the sledding figures to get far heavier once the calendar flips to November and Wilson's resume may be too tantalizing for Tomlin to pass up.",
                "Tomlin cautioned that the decision to give Wilson reps with the first team in practice this week has more to do with Wilson's experience and his resume than Fields' performance.",
                "“Justin has been an asset to us,\" Tomlin said.",
                "Just not enough of one for Tomlin to definitively hand the starting job to Fields outright. Tomlin declined to get into specifics on how he will divide the practice snaps with the first team and doesn't expect to make a decision on who will start against the Jets until later in the week.",
                "\"We’re just going to roll the ball out, let both guys work and make decisions from there,\" Tomlin said.",
                "Fields' play has allowed the Steelers to bring Wilson — who turns 36 next month — along slowly. Wilson initially injured the calf when the team reported to training camp in July and there was a concern when he aggravated it that it could lead to something more serious.",
                "Wilson has steadily improved and showed Tomlin last week that he could protect himself in practice. The next step will be knocking off whatever rust might remain from a month-plus of relative inactivity, though Tomlin doesn't sound overly concerned.",
                "Whoever the quarterback is will likely be playing behind a seventh different offensive line combination in as many weeks with rookie center Zach Frazier out with an ankle injury sustained against the Raiders. Fields' mobility — he's already run for five touchdowns — has helped offset the constant churn in front of him. That's not a tool that Wilson has had since the height of his “Let Russ Cook” days with Seattle several years ago.",
                "Asked how the offense might change with Wilson behind center, Tomlin smiled and said “it remains to be seen. And I think that’s one of the cute things about this discussion.”",
                "NOTES: LB Nick Herbig (hamstring) will miss his second straight game. ... There's a chance OLB Alex Highsmith (groin), out since a win over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sept. 22, could return. ... RB Cordarrelle Patterson (ankle) may also be available after missing two games.",

                "PITTSBURGH (AP) — Former President Barack Obama gave a blistering critique of his White House successor Donald Trump and urged Black men to show up for Kamala Harris as he opened a swing-state tour for the Democratic ticket.",
                "At a campaign field office to thank volunteers, Obama said Thursday he wanted to “speak some truths” after hearing reports on the ground that there was lower enthusiasm for Harris than there was for his own candidacy and that some Black men were thinking of sitting out the election.",
                "“Part of it makes me think — and I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,” Obama said.",
                "The former president said Trump’s penchant for putting people down was not real strength.",
                "“You’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that’s a sign of strength, because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down? That’s not acceptable,” Obama said.",
                "Trump responded in a post on his social media network Friday by ignoring Obama’s extended denunciation of him, suggesting the former president might secretly have his support, and by once again insulting Harris.",
                "“Obama admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men,” he wrote. “I think Obama will be voting for me because he doesn’t like the fact that Kamala is an extremely Low IQ Person!”",
                "Obama made the battleground state of Pennsylvania the first stop of his campaign tour with less than four weeks until Election Day and as voting is already underway. Speaking at a rally at the University of Pittsburgh, he painted Trump as out-of-touch and not the choice to lead the country to change, calling him a “bumbling” billionaire “who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.\"",
                "He said Harris is “a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a chance” and declared, “Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been.\"",
                "Obama, eight years out of power, has been one of the Democratic Party’s most reliable surrogates to galvanize voters. Until he was elected president in 2020, Joe Biden had also taken on that role for Democrats, but this year, since ending his reelection campaign and letting Harris ascend to the ticket, he’s yet to hit the trail.",
                "Obama, who received a roaring welcome from the crowd, described Trump’s all-caps posts on social media and his “ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories. The two-hour speeches, word salad, just — it’s like Fidel Castro. Just on and on. Constant attempts to sell you stuff. Who does that?”",
                "Obama listed some of the products Trump has tried to sell during his third White House campaign, including $399 gold sneakers, a $100,000 watch and his “God Bless the USA” Bible for $59.99.",
                "“He wants you to buy the word of God: Donald Trump edition. Got his name right there next to Matthew and Luke,” Obama said, laughing. “You could not make this stuff up.”",
                "The appearance by Obama, the nation’s first Black president, underscores the history-making nature of Harris' own political career. Harris, the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, would be the first woman to serve as president if elected next month.",
                "Obama's old campaign rallying cry, “Yes, We Can,” was even refashioned for the event, with “Yes, She Can” beaming on a screen over the crowd.",
                "Both Harris and Trump have been vying for support from Black Americans. A recent poll from the  AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black male and female voters on how they view the Democratic candidate.",
                "Black voters’ opinions of Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, according to the poll, but the former president believes his message on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make inroads into the Democrats’ traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men.",
                "Obama acknowledged that the last few years, starting with the pandemic, have been hard for Americans, with high prices and other stresses on working families.",
                "“I get it, why people are looking to shake things up. I mean, I am the hopey-changey guy. So I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better,” Obama said. “What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania.”",
                "He mocked Trump’s answer in the debate that he would replace Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, with “concepts of a plan,” and his running mate JD Vance’s recent comment that Trump worked to “salvage” the law.",
                "“Donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to tear it down. And by the way, he couldn’t even do that right.”",
                "Obama also referred to a new court filing in the federal election interference case against Trump that said Trump told an aide, “So what?” after being told his vice president, Mike Pence, had been rushed to a safe location after a violent crowd of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",

Even when a village prospered in one place, it would commonly split in two after the population had grown relatively large so that all cultivators would have ready access to the soil.",

The technological developments making it possible for humankind to live inurbanplaces were at first mainly advances inagriculture. Neolithic-era domestication of plants and animals eventually led to improved methods of cultivation and stock breeding, which eventually produced a surplus and made it possible to sustain a higher population density while also freeing up some members of the community for craftsmanship and the production of nonessential goods and services.",
                    "As human settlements increased in size through advances in irrigation and cultivation, the need for improving thecirculationof goods and people became ever moreacute. Pre-Neolithic humans, who led a nomadic existence in their never-ending search for food, moved largely by foot and carried their essential goods with the help of other humans. Neolithic people, upon achieving the domestication of animals, used them for transportation as well as for food and hides—thus making it possible to travel greater distances. Then came the use of draft animals in combination with a sledge equipped with runners for carrying heavier loads. The singular technological achievement in the early history of transportation, however, was the invention of thewheel, used first in theTigris-Euphratesvalleyabout 3500bcand constructed of solid materials (the development ofhubs, spokes, and rims would follow). Wheels, to be used efficiently, required roads, and thus came roadbuilding, an art most highly developed in ancient times by the Romans. Parallel improvements were made in water transport: irrigation ditches and freshwater supply routes first constructed in the 7th centurybcwere followed by the development of navigablecanals, whilerafts,dugouts, and reed floats were eventually succeeded by woodenboats.",

As the earliest urban populations, they were distinguished by literacy, technological progress (notably in metals), and increasinglysophisticatedforms of social and political organization (formalized in religious-legal codes and symbolized in temples and walls). Such places first developed in the Nile valley and on the SumeriancoastatUr, appearing in the Indus valley atMohenjo-daroduring the 3rd millenniumbc; by 2000bccities had also appeared in theWei Rivervalley inChina. The overland trade routes brought about the proliferation of cities from Turkestan to theCaspian Seaand then to thePersian Gulfand eastern Mediterranean. Their economic base in agriculture (supplemented by trade) and their political-religious institutions gave cities an unprecedented degree of occupational specialization and social stratification. City life was not insular, however, as many cities lent somecoherenceand direction to life and society in theirhinterlands."

The enjoyment of the imperial Roman peace entailed the acceptance of the status ofmunicipium—a respectable but subordinate rank within the Roman state. Themunicipiawere supported fiscally by taxes on trade, contributions from members of the community, and income from lands owned by eachmunicipium. Over time, however, the idea of public duty gave way to private ambition, especially as Roman citizenship became more universal (seecivitas). Municipal functions atrophied, and the city survived into theByzantineera principally as a mechanism of fiscal administration, although it often remained a locus of educational development and religious and cultural expression."

Theinitiativesof monastic orders, seigneurs, or lords of the manor, and merchants alike fostered a new era of increased tillage, craftsmanship and manufacturing, amoneyeconomy, scholarship, growth of rural population, and founding of “new towns,” as distinguished from those “Roman” cities that had survived from the period of Germanic and other encroachments. In almost all the “new” medieval towns, the role of the merchant was central in catalyzing thelong-distance tradeof commodities and staple goods.",
                    "Before the year 1000, contacts with rich Byzantine and Islamic areas in theLevanthad revitalized the mercantile power inVenice, which grew wealthy from its command of the profitable route to the Holy Land during theCrusades. Meanwhile, merchant communities had attached themselves to the more-accessible castle towns anddiocesesin northern Italy and on the main routes to the Rhineland and Champagne. They later appeared along the rivers ofFlandersand northern France and on the west-east road fromColognetoMagdeburg(seeHanseatic League). In all of these towns, trade was the key to their growth and development.",
                    "It was no coincidence that the 12th and 13th centuries, which saw the founding of more new towns than any time betweenthe fall of Romeand theIndustrial Revolution, also witnessed a singular upsurge toward civicautonomy. Throughout western Europe, towns acquired various kinds of municipal institutions loosely grouped under thedesignationcommune. Broadly speaking, the history of the medieval towns is that of the rising merchant classes seeking to free their communities from lordly jurisdiction and to secure their government to themselves. Wherevermonarchicalpower was strong, the merchants had to be content with a municipal status, but elsewhere they created city-states. Taking advantage of renewed conflict between popes and emperors, they allied with local nobility to establish communal self-government in the largest cities ofLombardy,Tuscany, andLiguria. InGermanythe city councils sometimes usurped the rights of higher clergy and nobility;Freiburg im Breisgauobtained itsexemplarycharter of liberties in 1120. The movement spread toLübeckand later to associated Hanse towns on the Baltic and North seas, touching even the Christian “colonial” towns east of the Elbe and Saale rivers. In the 13th century the great towns ofBruges,Ghent, andYpres, creditors of the counts ofFlanders, virtually governed the entireprovince. InFrance, revolutionary uprisings, directed against nobility and clergy, sometimes established free communes, but most communities were content with a franchise from their sovereign—despite their limitations compared with the relative liberty of English boroughs after theNorman Conquest. Finally thecorporatefreedom of the towns brought emancipation to individuals. When bishops in the older German cities treated newcomers as serfs, the emperorHenry Vaffirmed the principleStadtluft macht frei(German: “City air brings freedom”) in charters forSpeyerandWorms; such new towns, founded on the lands of lay and clerical lords, offered freedom and land to settlers who took up residence for more than “a year and a day.” In France thevilles neuves(“new towns”) andbastides(medieval French towns laid out on a rectangular grid) likewise conferred rights on servile persons.",
                    "In the 14th century the growth of urban centres subsided as Europe suffered a series of shocks that includedfaminefrom 1315 to 1317, the emergence of theBlack Death, which spread across Europe starting in 1347, and a period of politicalanarchyand economic decline that continued through the 15th century. Turkish encroachments on the routes to Asia worsened conditions in town and country alike. Europe turned inward upon itself, and, except for a few large centres, activity in the marketplace was depressed. At a time when local specialization and interregional exchange required more-liberal trade policies, craft protectionism and corporate particularism in the cities tended to hobble the course ofeconomic growth. The artisan and labouring classes, moreover, grew strong enough to challenge the oligarchical rule of the wealthy burghers and gentry through disruptions such as theRevolt of the Ciompi(1378), while socialwarfarepeaked in peasant uprisings typified by theJacquerie(1358), but these tended to be short-lived revolts that failed to bring enduringsocial change. The era of decline was relieved, some argue, by the slow process of individual emancipation and the cultural efflorescence of theRenaissance, which effectively grew out of the unique urbanenvironmentof Italy and was strengthened by a high regard for the Classical heritage. These values laid theintellectualbasis for the great age of geographic and scientific discovery exemplified in the new technologies ofgunpowder,mining,printing, andnavigation. Not before the triumph of princely government, in fact, did political allegiance, economic interests, and spiritual authority again become centred in a viable unit of organization, the absolutistnation-state."

While the nation stripped the cities of their remainingpretensionsto political and economic independence (heretofore symbolized in their walls andtariffbarriers), it created larger systems of interdependence in which territorialdivision of labourcould operate. National wealth also benefited from the newmercantilistpolicies, but all too often the wealth generated by cities was captured by the state in taxes and then dissipated—either in war or by supporting the splendour of court life and the Baroque glory of palaces and churches. Only in colonial areas, notably the Americas, did the age of expansion see the development of many new cities, and it is significant that the capitals and ports of the colonizing nations experienced their most rapid growth during these years. Under absolutist regimes, however, a few large political and commercial centres grew at the expense of smaller outlying communities and the rural hinterlands.",

Merchants resented their lack of political influence and assuredprestige, and they objected to outmoded regulations that created barriers to commerce—especially those that hindered their efforts to link commercial operations with improved production systems such as factories. Eventually, the merchants would unite with other dissident groups to curb the excesses of absolutism, erase the vestiges of feudalism, and secure a larger voice in the shaping of public policy. In northwestern Europe, where these liberal movements went furthest, the city populations and their influential bourgeois elites played a critical role that was disproportionate to their numbers.

TheOhio, Allegheny, and Monongahela rivers converge in the centre of the county to form an area known as theGolden Triangle; this was a strategic point ofcontentionbetween the French and the English, who fortified the area with Fort Duquesne (1754) and Fort Pitt (1761), respectively. With the defeat ofPontiac’s warriors (1763), the area opened up to settlers who foundedPittsburgh(1764), which became the county seat when Allegheny county was formed in 1788. The county’s name is derived from theDelawareIndianwordoolikhanna,meaning “good river.” The Triangle is now Pittsburgh’s central business district and the location of the popular Point State Park.",

                    "Pitt was born inLondonof a distinguished family. His mother, Lady Harriet Villiers, daughter of Viscount Grandison, belonged to the Anglo-Irish nobility; his father, Robert Pitt, member ofParliament, was the son ofThomas (“Diamond”) Pitt, governor of theEast India Company’s “factory” at Madras (nowChennai), India, where he made a vast fortune and secured one of the world’s largest diamonds (sold in 1717 to the regent of France). “Diamond” Pitt had returned from India with a despotic temper made devilish with spleen and gout; he quarrelled violently with his wife and declared war on “that hellish confusion that is my family,” but he treated his grandson William with affection. Father Robert was mean andcantankerous, and the Villiers blood was notoriously unstable. William inherited thegout, as well as a haughty temper and a strain of manic depression.",
                    "Such was the background and the smoky, explosiveinheritancethat was suddenly to blaze into genius. But William’s passionate temper and Pitt truculence had to bedisciplined, so he was sent toEton College, where he acquired social polish and learned to be aloof and yet agreeable, to be politelyinsolent. Delicate health and the early onset of gout deprived him of field sports and hunting, but he learned to ride with a good seat and take his port wine, and he enjoyed the select company of clever and well-connected friends—the twoGrenvilles(one to be Earl Temple; the other, George, to be first minister toGeorge III),George Lyttelton,Charles Pratt(to become a follower of Pitt and, as the 1st Earl Camden, a member of his 1766 ministry), and other men who would later become influential in politics, as well asHenry Fielding, author ofTom Jones.But Pitt hated the brutal harshness of Eton and determined to have his own sons educated at home. He continued his education atTrinity College,Oxford, but left after a year without taking a degree. He then spent several months at theUniversity of Utrechtin the Netherlands, probably studying law.",
                    "Hisclassicaleducation made him think, act, and speak in the grand Roman manner. His favourite poet wasVirgil, and he never forgot the patriotic lessons of Roman history; he constantly readCicero, the golden-tongued orator who couldyetlash offenders with his indignation. Later, in Parliament, his organ-like voice could be distinctly heard outside the House. This voice, perfect timing, and splendid gestures were worthy ofDavid Garrick, the greatest actor of the day and a personal friend; Pitt’s lean, tall, commanding figure, combined with a Roman beaky nose and hawklike eyes—large and gray but turning black when he was roused—overwhelmed all onlookers. To his countrymen he was to become almost a divine portent, a voice from theDelphic oracle.",
                    "For the present, possessed of a mere £100 a year, he nevertheless rejected the church, a younger son’s last resort as a career. While he was vegetating on a small family property inCornwall, which he called a “cursed hiding-place” in one of his many letters to his adored sister andconfidante, clever Nan (Ann) Pitt, help came from a politically powerful millionaire nobleman, LordCobham, who lived in splendour in a palatial mansion and vast park at Stowe, inBuckinghamshire, to which William and his friends paid visits. Cobham sent William abroad on “The Grand Tour” of Europe (only France and Switzerland were visited, however) and later bought him a cornetcy—a commission—in his ownregimentof horse (1731)."

                    "In 1735 Pitt was offered one of the“pocket” boroughs his brother controlled,  inWiltshire, and enteredParliament. He belonged to the small group known as “Cobham’s cubs” and the “boy patriots,” the connection of family friends and place hunters whom Cobham was mobilizing to oppose the ministry of SirRobert Walpole(later the 1st earl of Orford). Walpole had governedEnglandsince 1720, monopolizing patronage, and had—they thought—become too ready to compromise in foreign affairs for the sake of peace. The “patriots” joined other discontented Whigs such as John Carteret (later EarlGranville) and William Pulteney (later the 1st earl ofBath) to rally opposition forces behindFrederick Louis,prince of Wales, who was vehemently estranged from his father, KingGeorge II.",
                    "There were no formal political parties in the 18th century, and political power, together with the financial opportunities it brought, was a gift of patronage from a handful of landowning familyoligarchiesand from the monarch himself; nor was there a formal opposition in Parliament, and opposition to the king’s ministry was regarded as factious and even traitorous. Pitt’s maiden speech in Parliament was so critical of the ministry that it provoked Walpole to deprive him of his military commission, to “muzzle this terrible young cornet of horse.”",
                    "In 1737 the Prince of Wales made Pitt one of his court officials with a salary of £400 a year. He was still a relatively poor dependent of a powerful Whig clan but already showed an independence of mind and a readiness to appeal topublic opinionoutside Parliament that were new in English political life: when Walpole dismissed him from his cornetcy, he ostentatiously drove about London in a one-horse chaise tounderlinehis poverty. His talents as an orator had already become clear. He repeatedly referred to the “voice of England,” which had to be sought outside Parliament because Parliament was so packed with placemen and sinecurists. He claimed to speak for the commercial interests and even for the colonies overseas, the latter scarcely represented in theCommons. He was using arguments that carried far beyond the close interests of the Whig families; but he made lasting and valuable friendship with the rich sugar planter-aldermen of theCity of Londonin his opposition to Walpole’s cautious handling of thedisputeswith Spain over West Indian trade.",
                    "Walpole at last fell from power in 1742 and was replaced by a ministry that included his old colleaguesThomas Pelham-Holles, the 1st duke of Newcastle, and Philip Yorke, the 1st earl of Hardwicke, with Carteret as secretary of state. Pulteney was silenced by the grant of a peerage. The “boy patriots,” of whom Pitt was the acknowledged leader, were still excluded. They opposed Carteret even more vigorously than they had Walpole. In theWar of the Austrian Succession(1740–48), Pitt, a former warmonger, now vigorously opposed the sending of men and subsidies to check the French by protectingHanover(the king’s territory in Germany) and condemned Carteret as a “Hanover troop minister”: for this he was never forgiven by hissovereign.",
                    "Pitt insisted that French power should be opposed at sea and in its colonial possessions, not on the Continent. When Carteret was forced to resign in 1744, Newcastle and his brotherHenry Pelhamtook office and wanted to include Pitt in their ministry, butGeorge IIrefused to accept him, though he did accept Cobham, Lyttelton, and Grenville. It was at this time that Pitt first appeared in Parliament swathed in bandages, on crutches, and with a huge gout boot on his foot, parading his illness. But, in theJacobiterising of 1745 (theForty-five Rebellion), Pitt gained newstatureas the one effective statesman.",
                    "In February 1746 the king agreed to appoint Pitt joint vice treasurer of Ireland at £3,000 a year, and two months later he became paymaster general of the forces; he bowed very low as he kissed the king’s hands, but George wept with rage. The post of paymaster was one of the most sought after in government, with ample opportunity for corruption. There was an outcry from Pitt’s friends, who suspected he had been bought, but he proceeded to show both hiscontemptfor moneymaking and hisintegrityas an honest but comparatively poor man by ostentatiously refusing to take for himself any more than the official salary of more than £4,000 a year: he put the interest that paymasters before had appropriated to themselves, together with the accounts of the paymaster’s funds, into theBank of Englandand won the people’s hearts again. He introduced many reforms into the administration, and, though he supported the Pelhams’ alliance with Hanover (which was a change of tack), he tried also to strengthen British naval power.",
                    "Alegacyof £10,000 from the old duchess ofMarlboroughat this time, left to Pitt “for the noble defence he has made for the support of the laws of England, and to prevent the ruin of his country,” enabled him to indulge in more lavish expenditure and generosity. He spent a good deal onlandscape gardeningand bought a new property near London. After a furious quarrel, he became estranged from his sister Nan, who had been his hostess for years.",
                    "When Henry Pelham died in office in 1754, Pitt hoped for advancement, but, after much reshuffling and intrigue, Newcastle and Henry Fox (later1st Baron Holland) abandoned him for the sake of expediency. He then became ill and retired to a new house atBath, groaning “I wish for nothing but a decent and innocent retreat, not to afford the world the ridiculousspectacleof being passed by every boat that navigates the river.” An invalid and an aging bachelor, he suddenly fell in love with Lady Hester Grenville, became engaged at once, and was married by November 1754. She was 33 and he 46, and she adored him, possibly from the times in her childhood when he had visited Stowe with her brothers. She was attractive, clever, patient, and eminently practical—particularly about money, arranging mortgages, satisfying creditors, and pouring away her own fortune, in his last years of grandiose extravagance, to protect him.",
                    "It proved to be an ideally happy marriage with a well-ordered, loving home and family (“the infantry” Pitt called them); later he was to be found making hay with them at Hayes Place, his house inKent, going for picnics, and chasing butterflies. He magically became healthy and happy, ready for his last big parliamentary fight for high office. But first, because of his attacks on Newcastle’s ministry, he was dismissed, penniless, from the pay office in 1755. His brother-in-law Earl Temple helped with an annuity of £1,000."

These technological changes introduced novel ways of working and living and fundamentally transformed society. This process began inBritainin the 18th century and from there spread to other parts of the world. Although used earlier by French writers, the termIndustrial Revolutionwas first popularized by the English economic historianArnold Toynbee(1852–83) to describeBritain’seconomic development from 1760 to 1840. Since Toynbee’s time the term has been more broadly applied as a process of economictransformationthan as a period of time in a particular setting. This explains why some areas, such asChinaandIndia, did not begin their first industrial revolutions until the 20th century, while others, such as theUnited Statesand westernEurope, began undergoing “second” industrial revolutions by the late 19th century.",

Workers acquired new and distinctive skills, and their relation to their tasks shifted; instead of being craftsmen working withhand tools, they became machine operators, subject tofactorydiscipline. Finally, there was a psychological change: confidence in the ability to use resources and to master nature was heightened."

Blast furnaces are used to producepig ironfromironore for subsequent processing intosteel, and they are also employed in processinglead,copper, and other metals. Rapidcombustionis maintained by the current of air under pressure.",
                "Blast furnaces producepig ironfrom iron ore by the reducing action ofcarbon(supplied ascoke) at a high temperature in the presence of a fluxing agent such aslimestone. Ironmaking blast furnaces consist of several zones: a crucible-shapedhearthat the bottom of the furnace; an intermediate zone called a bosh between the hearth and thestack;a vertical shaft (the stack) that extends from the bosh to the top of the furnace; and the furnace top, which contains a mechanism for charging the furnace. The furnace charge, or burden, of iron-bearing materials (e.g., iron ore pellets and sinter), coke, and flux (e.g., limestone) descends through the shaft, where it is preheated and reacts with ascending reducing gases to produce liquid iron and slag that accumulate in the hearth. Air that has been preheated to temperatures from 900 to 1,250 °C (1,650 and 2,300 °F), together with injected fuel such asoilornatural gas, is blown into the furnace through multipletuyeres(nozzles) located around the circumference of the furnace near the top of the hearth; these nozzles may number from 12 to as many as 40 on large furnaces. The preheated air is, in turn, supplied from a bustle pipe, a large-diameter pipe encircling the furnace. The preheated air reacts vigorously with the preheated coke, resulting in both the formation of the reducing gas (carbon monoxide) that rises through the furnace and a very high temperature of about 1,650 °C (3,000 °F) that produces the liquid iron and slag.",
                "Theboshis the hottest part of the furnace because of its closeproximityto the reaction between air and coke. Molten iron accumulates in thehearth, which has a taphole to draw off the molten iron and, higher up, a slag hole to remove the mixture of impurities and flux. The hearth and bosh are thick-walled structures lined with carbon-typerefractoryblocks, while the stack is lined with high-qualityfireclay brickto protect the furnace shell. To keep these refractory materials from burning out, plates, staves, or sprays for circulating cool water are built into them.",
                "The stack is kept full with alternating layers of coke, ore, and limestone admitted at the top during continuous operation. Coke is ignited at the bottom and burned rapidly with the forced air from the tuyeres. The iron oxides in the ore are chemically reduced to molten iron by carbon andcarbon monoxidefrom the coke. Theslagformed consists of the limestoneflux, ash from the coke, and substances formed by the reaction of impurities in the ore with the flux; it floats in a molten state on the top of the molten iron. Hot gases rise from the combustion zone,heatingfresh material in the stack and then passing out through ducts near the top of the furnace.",
                "Blast furnaces may have the followingancillaryfacilities: a stock house where the furnace burden is prepared prior to being elevated to the furnace top by skip cars or a belt conveyor system; a top-charging system consisting of a vertical set of double bells (cones) or rotating chutes to prevent the release of furnace gas during charging; stoves that use the furnace off-gases to preheat the air delivered to the tuyeres; and a cast house, consisting of troughs that distribute liquid iron and slag to appropriate ladles for transfer to steelmaking furnaces and slag-reclamation areas.",
                "InEurope, the blast furnace developed gradually over the centuries from small furnaces operated by the Romans, in whichcharcoalwas used for reducing ore to a semisolid mass of iron containing a relatively small amount of carbon and slag. The iron mass was then hammered to remove the slag,yieldingwrought iron. Increases in the height of the furnace, coupled with mechanicalbellowsfor introducing greater amounts of air into it, allowed the higher temperatures needed to produce a high-carbon iron known as cast, or pig, iron. This mode of production was used in central Europe by the mid-14th century and was introduced into England about 1500. Charcoal was the only furnace fuel until the 17th century, when the depletion of forests that provided the charcoal in England led to experiments with coke, which is produced fromcoal. Coke had been widely adopted for use in blast furnaces by the mid-18th century, and the principle of heating air before it entered the furnace was introduced in the early 19th century.",
                "Modern blast furnaces range in size from 20 to 110 metres (70 to 360 feet), have hearth diameters of 6 to 15 metres (20 to 50 feet), and can produce from 1,000 to about 15,000 tons of pig iron daily. Steelmaking accounts for about 8 percent of globalgreenhouse gasemissions—the most of any industry—and these emissions contribute toglobal warming. Some blast furnaces have been fitted withcarbon capturetechnologyto decrease the amount ofcarbon dioxideemitted. However, some steelmakers plan to use ahydrogen-based process that would not require blast furnaces and would emit only water as a by-product."

By far the most widely used material forbuildingthe world’sinfrastructureand industries, it is used to fabricate everything from sewing needles tooiltankers. In addition, the tools required to build and manufacture such articles are also made of steel. As an indication of the relative importance of this material, in 2013 the world’s raw steel production was about 1.6 billion tons, while production of the next most important engineeringmetal,aluminum, was about 47 million tons. (For a list of steel production by country,see belowWorld steel production.) The main reasons for the popularity of steel are the relatively low cost of making, forming, and processing it, theabundanceof its two raw materials (ironoreand scrap), and its unparalleled range of mechanical properties."

                    "The major component of steel is iron, a metal that in its pure state is not much harder thancopper. Omitting very extreme cases, iron in itssolid stateis, like all other metals, polycrystalline—that is, it consists of manycrystalsthat join one another on their boundaries. A crystal is a well-ordered arrangement of atoms that can best be pictured as spheres touching one another. They are ordered in planes, called lattices, which penetrate one another in specific ways. For iron, the lattice arrangement can best be visualized by a unit cube with eight iron atoms at its corners. Important for the uniqueness of steel is the allotropy of iron—that is, its existence in two crystalline forms. In thebody-centred cubic(bcc) arrangement, there is an additional iron atom in the centre of each cube. In theface-centred cubic(fcc) arrangement, there is one additional iron atom at the centre of each of the six faces of the unit cube. It is significant that the sides of the face-centred cube, or the distances between neighbouring lattices in the fcc arrangement, are about 25 percent larger than in the bcc arrangement; this means that there is more space in the fcc than in the bcc structure to keep foreign (i.e.,alloying) atoms insolid solution.",
                    "Iron has its bcc allotropy below 912° C (1,674° F) and from 1,394° C (2,541° F) up to itsmelting pointof 1,538° C (2,800° F). Referred to asferrite, iron in its bcc formation is also calledalpha ironin the lower temperature range anddelta ironin the higher temperature zone. Between 912° and 1,394° C iron is in its fcc order, which is calledausteniteor gamma iron. The allotropic behaviour of iron is retained with few exceptions in steel, even when thealloycontains considerable amounts of other elements.",
                    "There is also the termbeta iron, which refers not to mechanical properties but rather to the strong magnetic characteristics of iron. Below 770° C (1,420° F), iron is ferromagnetic; the temperature above which it loses this property is often called theCurie point."

                    "In its pure form, iron is soft and generally not useful as an engineering material; the principal method of strengthening it and converting it into steel is by adding small amounts ofcarbon. In solid steel, carbon is generally found in two forms. Either it is in solid solution in austenite and ferrite or it is found as a carbide. The carbide form can be iron carbide (Fe3C, known ascementite), or it can be a carbide of an alloying element such astitanium. (On the other hand, in gray iron, carbon appears as flakes or clusters ofgraphite, owing to the presence ofsilicon, which suppresses carbide formation.)",
                    "The effects of carbon are best illustrated by an iron-carbonequilibriumdiagram. The A-B-C line represents the liquidus points (i.e.,the temperatures at which molten iron begins tosolidify), and the H-J-E-C line represents the solidus points (at which solidification is completed). The A-B-C line indicates that solidification temperatures decrease as the carbon content of an iron melt is increased. (This explains why gray iron, which contains more than 2 percent carbon, is processed at much lower temperatures than steel.) Molten steel containing, for example, a carbon content of 0.77 percent (shown by the vertical dashed line in the figure) begins to solidify at about 1,475° C (2,660° F) and is completely solid at about 1,400° C (2,550° F). From this point down, the iron crystals are all in an austenitic—i.e.,fcc—arrangement and contain all of the carbon in solid solution. Cooling further, a dramatic change takes place at about 727° C (1,341° F) when the austenite crystals transform into a fine lamellar structure consisting of alternating platelets of ferrite and iron carbide. This microstructure is calledpearlite, and the change is called theeutectoidic transformation. Pearlite has adiamond pyramid hardness (DPH) of approximately 200 kilograms-force per square millimetre (285,000 pounds per square inch), compared with a DPH of 70 kilograms-force per square millimetre for pure iron. Cooling steel with a lower carbon content (e.g.,0.25 percent) results in a microstructure containing about 50 percent pearlite and 50 percent ferrite; this is softer than pearlite, with a DPH of about 130. Steel with more than 0.77 percent carbon—for instance, 1.05 percent—contains in its microstructure pearlite and cementite; it is harder than pearlite and may have a DPH of 250."

This sectional conflict between Northern states and slaveholding Southern states had been tempered by a series of political compromises, but by the late 1850s the issue of the extension of slavery to the western states had reached a boiling point. The election ofAbraham Lincoln, a member of the antislaveryRepublican Party, as president in1860precipitated the secession of 11 Southern states, leading to a civil war.",

TheBattle of Gettysburg, one of the bloodiest engagements during the Civil War, resulted in about 7,000 deaths and 51,000 total casualties.",

Between 1815 and 1861 the economy of the Northern states was rapidly modernizing and diversifying. Although agriculture—mostly smaller farms that relied on free labour—remained the dominant sector in the North, industrialization had taken root there. Moreover, Northerners had invested heavily in an expansive and varied transportation system that included canals, roads, steamboats, and railroads; in financial industries such as banking and insurance; and in a large communications network that featured inexpensive, widely available newspapers, magazines, and books, along with the telegraph.",
                    "By contrast, the Southern economy was based principally on large farms (plantations) that produced commercial crops such ascottonand that relied on slaves as the mainlabour force. Rather thaninvestin factories or railroads as Northerners had done, Southerners invested their money in slaves—even more than in land; by 1860, 84 percent of the capital invested in manufacturing was invested in the free (nonslaveholding) states. Yet, to Southerners, as late as 1860, this appeared to be a sound business decision. The price of cotton, the South’s defining crop, had skyrocketed in the 1850s, and the value of slaves—who were, after all, property—rose commensurately. By 1860 the per capita wealth of Southern whites was twice that of Northerners, and three-fifths of the wealthiest individuals in the country were Southerners.",
                    "Theextensionof slavery into new territories and states had been an issue as far back as theNorthwest Ordinanceof 1784. When the slave territory ofMissourisought statehood in 1818, Congress debated for two years before arriving upon theMissouri Compromiseof 1820. This was the first of a series of political deals that resulted from arguments between pro-slavery and antislavery forces over the expansion of the “peculiar institution,” as it was known, into the West. The end of theMexican-American Warin 1848 and the roughly 500,000 square miles (1.3 million square km) of new territory that the United States gained as a result of it added a new sense of urgency to the dispute. More and more Northerners, driven by a sense ofmoralityor an interest in protecting free labour, came to believe, in the 1850s, that bondage needed to beeradicated. White Southerners feared that limiting the expansion of slavery would consign the institution to certain death. Over the course of the decade, the two sides became increasingly polarized and politicians less able to contain the dispute through compromise. WhenAbraham Lincoln, the candidate of the explicitly antislaveryRepublican Party, won the1860 presidential election, seven Southern states (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas) carried out their threat and seceded, organizing as theConfederate States of America.",
                    "In the early morning hours of April 12, 1861, rebels opened fire onFort Sumter,at the entrance to the harbour ofCharleston, South Carolina. Curiously, this firstencounterof what would be the bloodiest war in the history of the United States claimed no victims. After a 34-hour bombardment, Maj.Robert Andersonsurrendered his command of about 85 soldiers to some 5,500 besieging Confederate troops underP.G.T. Beauregard. Within weeks, four more Southern states (Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina) left the Union to join the Confederacy.",
                    "With war upon the land, President Lincoln called for 75,000 militiamen to serve for three months. He proclaimed anaval blockadeof the Confederate states, although he insisted that they did not legallyconstituteasovereigncountry but were instead states in rebellion. He also directed the secretary of the treasury to advance $2 million to assist in the raising of troops, and he suspended the writ ofhabeas corpus, first along the East Coast and ultimately throughout the country. The Confederate government had previously authorized a call for 100,000 soldiers for at least six months’ service, and this figure was soon increased to 400,000."

When population density is high, mortality tends to increase because of competition for resources, predation, or increased disease transmission, resulting in the plateau in growth at the end of the curve. Population growth rates may also fluctuate in correlation with seasonal variations in the environment. For example, in deep lakes, a spring thaw causes colder, deeper waters to rise to the lake’s surface, releasing nutrients that then cause bursts in the growth ofplankton, includingalgae,bacteria, andprotozoans(seewater bloom).",

Thevastenergy potential of nuclear fusion was first exploited inthermonuclear weapons, or hydrogen bombs, which were developed in the decade immediately followingWorld War II. The potential peaceful applications of nuclear fusion, especially in view of the essentially limitless supply of fusion fuel on Earth, have encouraged an immense effort to harness this process for the production of power. Although practical fusion reactors have not been built yet, the necessary conditions of plasma temperature and heat insulation have been largely achieved, suggesting that fusion energy for electric-power production is now a serious possibility.

                "poverty,  the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions. Poverty is said to exist when people lack the means to satisfy their basic needs. In thiscontext, the identification of poor people first requires a determination of whatconstitutesbasic needs. These may be defined as narrowly as “those necessary for survival” or as broadly as “those reflecting the prevailingstandard of livingin the community.” The firstcriterionwould cover only those people near the borderline of starvation or death from exposure; the second would extend to people whose nutrition, housing, and clothing, though adequate to preserve life, do not measure up to those of the population as a whole. The problem of definition is furthercompoundedby the noneconomicconnotationsthat the word poverty has acquired. Poverty has been associated, for example, with poor health, low levels ofeducationor skills, an inability or an unwillingness to work, high rates of disruptive or disorderly behaviour, and improvidence. While these attributes have often been found to exist with poverty, their inclusion in a definition of poverty would tend to obscure the relation between them and the inability to provide for one’s basic needs. Whatever definition one uses, authorities and laypersons alike commonly assume that the effects of poverty are harmful to both individuals and society.",
                "Although poverty is a phenomenon as old ashumanhistory, its significance has changed over time. Under traditional (i.e., nonindustrialized) modes of economic production,widespreadpoverty had been accepted as inevitable. The total output of goods and services, even if equally distributed, would still have been insufficient to give the entirepopulationa comfortable standard of living by prevailing standards. With the economic productivity that resulted fromindustrialization, however, this ceased to be the case—especially in the world’s mostindustrialized countries, where national outputs were sufficient to raise the entire population to a comfortable level if the necessary redistribution could be arranged without adversely affecting output.",
                "Several types of poverty may be distinguished depending on such factors as time or duration (long- or short-term or cyclical) and distribution (widespread, concentrated, individual).",

                    "Cyclical poverty refers to poverty that may be widespread throughout a population, but the occurrence itself is of limited duration. In nonindustrial societies (present and past), this sort of inability to provide for one’s basic needs rests mainly upon temporary food shortages caused by natural phenomena or poor agricultural planning. Prices would rise because of scarcities of food, which brought widespread,albeittemporary, misery.",
                    "In industrialized societies the chief cyclical cause of poverty is fluctuations in thebusiness cycle, with mass unemployment during periods ofdepressionor seriousrecession. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the industrialized nations of the world experienced business panics and recessions that temporarily enlarged the numbers of the poor. TheUnited States’experience in theGreat Depressionof the 1930s, though unique in some of its features, exemplifies this kind of poverty. And until the Great Depression, poverty resulting from business fluctuations was accepted as an inevitable consequence of a natural process of marketregulation.Reliefwas granted to theunemployedto tide them over until the business cycle again entered an upswing. The experiences of the Great Depression inspired a generation of economists such asJohn Maynard Keynes, who sought solutions to the problems caused by extreme swings in the business cycle. Since the Great Depression, governments in nearly all advanced industrial societies have adopted economic policies that attempt to limit the ill effects of economic fluctuation. In this sense, governments play an activerolein poverty alleviation by increasing spending as a means ofstimulatingthe economy. Part of this spending comes in the form of direct assistance to the unemployed, either throughunemployment compensation, welfare, and other subsidies or by employment on public-works projects. Although business depressions affect all segments of society, the impact is most severe on people of the lowest socioeconomic strata because they have fewer marginal resources than those of a higher strata."

Both generalized and concentrated collective poverty may be transmitted from generation to generation, parents passing their poverty on to their children.",
                    "Collective poverty is relatively general and lasting in parts of Asia, theMiddle East, most of Africa, and parts ofSouth AmericaandCentral America. Life for the bulk of the population in these regions is at a minimal level. Nutritionaldeficienciescausediseaseseldom seen by doctors in the highly developed countries. Lowlife expectancy, high levels of infant mortality, and poor health characterize life in these societies.",
                    "Collective poverty is usually related to economic underdevelopment. The total resources of manydeveloping nationsin Africa, Asia, and South and Central America would be insufficient to support the population adequately even if they were equally divided among all of the citizens. Proposed remedies are twofold: (1) expansion of thegross national product(GNP) through improved agriculture or industrialization, or both, and (2) population limitation. Thus far, both population control andinducedeconomic development in many countries have proved difficult, controversial, and at times inconclusive or disappointing in their results.",
                    "An increase of the GNP does not necessarily lead to an improved standard of living for the population at large, for a number of reasons. The most important reason is that, in many developing countries, the population grows even faster than the economy does, with no net reduction in poverty as a result. This increasedpopulation growthstems primarily from loweredinfant mortality ratesmade possible by improved sanitary and disease-control measures. Unless such lowered rates eventually result in women bearing fewer children, the result is a sharp acceleration in population growth. To reduce birth rates, some developing countries have undertaken nationally administered family-planning programs, with varying results. Many developing nations are also characterized by a long-standing system of unequaldistribution of wealth—a system likely to continue despite marked increases in the GNP. Some authorities have observed the tendency for a large portion of any increase to be siphoned off by persons who are already wealthy, while others claim that increases in GNP will always trickle down to the part of the population living at the subsistence level."

Their chief economic traits are unemployment and underemployment, unskilled occupations, and job instability.

This inability is generally related to the lack of some basic attribute that would permit the individual to maintain himself or herself. Such persons may, for example, be blind, physically or emotionallydisabled, or chronically ill. Physical and mental handicaps are usually regarded sympathetically, as being beyond the control of the people who suffer from them.

Anadroitself-publicist, he projected a concept of the artist as an impersonal, even vacuous, figure who is nevertheless a successful celebrity, businessman, and social climber.",

By 1963 he was mass-producing these purposelybanalimages of consumer goods by means of photographicsilkscreenprints, and he then beganprintingendless variations of portraits of celebrities in garish colours. The silkscreen technique was ideally suited to Warhol, for the repeated image was reduced to aninsipidand dehumanized cultural icon that reflected both the supposed emptiness of Americanmaterial culture, awash inconsumerismandbrand marketing, and the artist’s emotional noninvolvement with the practice of his art. Warhol’s work placed him in the forefront of the emerging Pop art movement in America.",

Warhol had by this time become a well-known fixture on the fashion and avant-garde art scene and was an influential celebrity in his own right. Throughout the 1970s and until his death, he continued to produce prints depicting political and Hollywood celebrities, notablyMarilyn Monroe. He also involved himself in a wide range of advertising illustrations and other commercial art projects.

                    "TheUnited Statesis credited with developing several popularsports, including some (such as baseball,gridiron football, andbasketball) that have large fan bases and, to varying degrees, have been adopted internationally. But baseball, despite the spread of the game throughout the globe and the growing influence of Asian and Latin American leagues and players, is the sport that Americans still recognize as their “national pastime.” The game has long beenwoveninto the fabric of American life and identity. “It’s our game,” exclaimed the poetWalt Whitmanmore than a century ago, “that’s the chief fact in connection with it: America’s game.” He went on to explain that baseball",
                    "has the snap, go, fling of the American atmosphere—it belongs as much to our institutions, fits into them as significantly, as our constitutions, laws: is just as important in the sum total of our historic life. It is the place where memory gathers.",
                    "Perhaps Whitman exaggerated baseball’s importance to and its congruency with life in the United States, but few would argue the contrary, that baseball has been merely a simple or an occasional diversion.",
                    "It was nationalisticsentimentthat helped to make baseball “America’s game.” In the quest to obtain greater culturalautonomy, Americans yearned for a sport they could claim as exclusively their own. Just as the English hadcricketand the Germans theirturnvereins (gymnastic clubs), a sporting newspaper declared as early as 1857 that Americans should have a “game that could be termed a ‘Native American Sport.’ ” A powerful confirmation of baseball as the sport to fill that need came in 1907 when a special commission appointed byA.G. Spalding, a sporting goods magnate who had formerly been a star pitcher and an executive with a baseball team, reported that baseball owed absolutely nothing to England and thechildren’s gameofrounders. Instead, the commission claimed that, to the best of its knowledge (a knowledge based on flimsy research and self-serving logic), baseball had been invented byAbner DoubledayatCooperstown,New York, in 1839. This originmythwas perpetuated for decades.",
                    "In a countrycomprisinga multiplicity of ethnic and religious groups, one without a monarchy, anaristocracy, or a long and mythic past, the experience of playing, watching, and talking about baseball games became one of the nation’s great common denominators. It provided, in the perceptive words of British novelistVirginia Woolf, “a centre, a meeting place for the divers activities of a people whom a vast continent isolates [and] whom no tradition controls.” No matter where one lived, the “hit-and-run,” the “double play,” and the “sacrifice bunt” were carried out the same way. The unifying power of baseball in the United States was evident in the Depression-ravaged 1930s, when a group of Cooperstown’s businessmen along with officials from the major leagues established theNational Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The Hall of Fame became a quasi-religious shrine for many Americans, and, since its founding, millions of fans have made “pilgrimages” to Cooperstown, where they have observed the “relics”—old bats, balls, and uniforms—of bygone heroes.",
                    "Baseball also reshaped the nation’s calendar. With the rise of industrialization, the standardized clock time of the office or factory robbed people of the earlier experience of time in its rich associations with the daylight hours, the natural rhythms of the seasons, and the traditional church calendar.Yet, for Americans, the opening of the baseball training season signaled the arrival of spring, regular-season play meant summer, and the World Series marked the arrival of fall. In the winter, baseball fans participated in “hot stove leagues,” reminiscing about past games and greats and speculating about what the next season had to offer.",
                    "TheWorld Series, inaugurated in 1903 and pitting the champions of the American and National Leagues in a postseason play-off, quickly took its place alongside theFourth of Julyand Christmas as one of the most popular annual rites. The series was, saidEverybody’s Magazinein 1911, “the veryquintessenceand consummation of the Most Perfect Thing in America.” Each fall it absorbed the entire nation.",
                    "Baseball terms and phrases, such as “He threw me a curve,” “Her presentation covered all the bases,” and “He’s really out in left field,” soon became part of the national vocabulary, so entrenched is baseball in the ordinary conversation of Americans. During the administration of PresidentGeorge H.W. Bush, a baseball player during his years atYale University, the foreign press struggled to translate the president’s routine use of baseballmetaphors. As early as the 1850s, baseball images began to appear in periodicals, and, in the 20th century, popular illustratorNorman Rockwelloften used baseball as the subject for hisThe Saturday Evening Postcovers. “Casey at the Bat” and “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” remain among the best-known poems and songs, respectively, among Americans. Novelists and filmmakers frequently have turned to baseball motifs. After the mid-20th century, at the very time baseball at the grassroots level had begun a perceptible descent, baseball fiction proliferated. American colleges and universities even began to offer courses on baseball literature, and baseball films likewise proliferated. In 1994 the Public Broadcasting System releasedKen Burns’snostalgicBaseball, arguably the most monumental historical television documentary ever made.",
                    "While baseball possessed enormous integrative powers, the game’s history also has been interwoven with and reflective of major social and cultural cleavages. Until the first decades of the 20th century, middle-class Evangelical Protestants viewed the sport with profound suspicion. They associated baseball, or at least the professional version of the game, with ne’er-do-wells, immigrants, the working class, drinking, gambling, and general rowdiness. Conversely, these very qualities provided a foothold for the upward ascent of ethnic groups from the nation’s ghettos. Usually encountering lessdiscriminationin baseball (as well as in othervenuesof commercial entertainment) than they did in the more “respectable” occupations, in the 19th century Irish and German Americans were soconspicuousin professional baseball that some observers wondered if they had a special capacity for playing the game.",
                    "For a brief time in the 1880s, beforeracial segregationbecame the norm in the United States,Blackplayers competed with whites in professional baseball. After that period, however, Blacks had to carve out a separate world of baseball. Dozens of Black teams faced local semiprofessional teams while barnstorming throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Despite playing a high quality of baseball, the players frequently engaged in various forms of clowning that perpetuated prevailingstereotypesof Blacks to appeal to spectators. From the 1920s until the ’50s, separate Black professional leagues—theNegro leagues—existed as well, but in 1947Jackie Robinsoncrossed the long-standing colour bar inmajor league baseball. Because baseball was the national game, its racialintegrationwas of enormous symbolic importance in the United States; indeed, it preceded the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision ending racial segregation in the schools (in 1954 inBrownv.Board of Education of Topeka) and helped to usher in thecivil rights movementof the 1950s and ’60s. Moreover, in the 1980s and ’90s a huge influx of Hispanics into professional baseball reflected the country’s changing ethniccomposition.",
                    "Baseball likewise contributed to the shaping of Americanconceptionsof gender roles. Althoughwomenwere playing baseball as early as the 1860s, their involvement in the sport was confined for the most part to the role of spectator. To counter the game’s reputation for rowdiness, baseball promoters took pains to encourage women to attend. “The presence of an assemblage of ladies purifies themoralatmosphere of a baseball gathering,” reported theBaseball Chronicle, “repressing as it does, all the out-burst of intemperate language which the excitement of a contest so frequently induces.” When women played on barnstorming teams in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, the press routinely referred to them as “Amazons,” “freaks,” or “frauds.” In 1943, duringWorld War II, when it was feared that professional baseball might be forced to close down, theAll-American Girls Professional Baseball Leaguemade its debut. After having provided more than 600 women an opportunity to play baseball and to entertain several million fans, the league folded in 1954.",
                    "But, even if unable to heal conflicts arising from fundamental social divisions, baseball exhibited an extraordinarycapacityfor fostering ties. In the 1850s, young artisans and clerks, frequently displaced in the city and finding their way of life changing rapidly in the midst of theIndustrial Revolution, conceived of themselves as members of what was known as the “base ball fraternity.” Like the volunteer fire departments and militia units of the day, they donned special uniforms, developed their own rituals, and, in playing baseball, shared powerful common experiences. Playing and watching baseball contests also strengthened occupational, ethnic, and racial identities. Butchers, typesetters, draymen, bricklayers, and even clergymen organized baseball clubs. So did Irish Americans, German Americans, and African Americans.",
                    "Professional baseball nourished and deepened urban identities. “If we are ahead of the big city [New York] in nothing else,” crowed theBrooklyn Eagleas early as 1862, “we can beat her in baseball.” Fans invested their emotions in their professional representative nines. “A deep gloom settled over the city,” reported a Chicago newspaper in 1875 after the local White Stockings had been defeated by the St. Louis (Missouri) Brown Stockings. “Friends refused to recognize friends, lovers became estranged, and business was suspended.” Even in the late 20th century, in an age more given tocynicism, the successes and failures of professional teams continued to evoke strong feelings among local residents. For example, during the 1990s, after having experienced urban decay and demoralization in the previous two decades,Clevelandexperienced a great civic revival fueled in part by the success of the Indians baseball team.",
                    "The significance of specific baseball teams and individual players extended beyond the localities that they represented. TheNew York Yankees, who in the first half of the 20th century were the quintessential representatives of the big city, of the East, of urban America with its sophistication, and of ethnic and religious heterogeneity, became synonymous with supernal success, while theSt. Louis Cardinalsemerged as the quintessential champions of the Midwest, of small towns and the farms, of rural America with its simplicity, rusticity, and old-stock Protestanthomogeneity. In the 1920sBabe Ruthbecame the diamond’s colossal demigod. To those toiling on assembly lines or sitting at their desks in corporatebureaucracies, Ruth embodied America’s continuing faith in upwardsocial mobility. His mighty home runs furnished vivid proof that men remained masters of their own destinies and that they could still rise from mean, vulgar beginnings to fame and fortune. For African Americans, Black stars such asSatchel PaigeandJosh Gibsonfurnished equally compelling models of individual inspiration and success.",
                    "Baseball parksbecame important local civic monuments and repositories ofcollectivememories. The first parks had been jerry-built, flimsy wooden structures, but between 1909 and 1923 some 15 major league clubs constructed new, more permanent parks of steel and concrete. These edifices were akin to the great public buildings, skyscrapers, and railway terminals of the day; local residents proudly pointed to them as evidence of their city’s size and its achievements.",
                    "Seeing them as retreats from the noise, dirt, and squalor of the industrial city, the owners gave the first parks pastoral names—Ebbets Field, Sportsman’s Park, and the Polo Grounds—but, with the construction of symmetrical, multisports facilities in the 1960s and ’70s, urban and futuristic names such asAstrodomeand Kingdome predominated. In a new park-building era in the 1990s, designers sought to recapture theambienceof earlier times by designing “retro parks,” a term that was something of anoxymoronin that, while the new parks offered the fan the intimacy of the old-time parks, they simultaneously provided modern conveniences such as escalators, climate-controlled lounges, high-tech audiovisual systems, Disneyesque play areas for children, and space for numerous retail outlets. The increasing corporate influence on the game was reflected in park names such as Network Associates Stadium andBank OneBallpark.",
                    "After about the mid-20th century, baseball’s claim to being America’s game rested on more precarious foundations than in the past. The sport facedpotentcompetition, not only from other professional sports (especially gridiron football) but even more from a massive conversion of Americans from public to private, at-home diversions. Attendance as a percentage of population fell at all levels of baseball, the minor leagues became a shell of their former selves, and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams folded. In the 1990s, player strikes, free agency, disparities in competition, and the rising cost of attending games added to the woes of major league baseball. Yet, baseball continued to exhibit a remarkable resiliency; attendance at professional games improved, and attendance at minor league games was close to World War II records by the end of the century. As the 21st century opened, baseball still faced serious problems, but the sport was gaining in popularity around the world, and a strong case could still be made for baseball holding a special place in the hearts and minds of the American people."

(Ownership of the team remains within the Rooney family to this day.) The team was not an early success; it qualified for the playoffs just once in its first 37 years. In 1940 the team changed its nickname to “Steelers” in tribute to Pittsburgh’smain industryat the time. The Steelers tied for the NFL Eastern Division title in 1947, but they were shut out 21–0 by thePhiladelphia Eaglesin a playoff match to qualify for the NFL championship game. Rooney watched the Steelers struggle through the 1950s and ’60s until their fortunes turned around with the arrival of head coachChuck Noll in 1969.",
                    "From 1969 to 1972 Noll showcased his amazing skill at recognizing talent as he drafted five future Hall of Famers: defensive tackle“Mean” Joe Greene, quarterbackTerry Bradshaw, defensive back Mel Blount, linebacker Jack Ham, and running backFranco Harris(remembered for his “Immaculate Reception,” a game-winning catch in the playoffs against theOakland Raidersin 1972, one of the most remarkable and controversial plays in professionalfootballhistory). In 1974 Noll selected four more players who would eventually be inducted into the Hall of Fame: center Mike Webster, receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth, and linebacker Jack Lambert. These players went on to form adynastyof unmatched success, winning four Super Bowls (1975,1976,1979, and1980) in six seasons behind a dominant defense known as the “Steel Curtain” and an efficient offense led by Bradshaw. The Steelers teams of the 1970s were also characterized by aferventfan base, notable for the bright yellow “Terrible Towels”—which were created by the team’s popular andidiosyncraticradio broadcaster for 35 years,Myron Cope—that fans would wave during home games. Pittsburgh faded slightly in the 1980s, with four postseason berths in the decade, and Noll retired in 1991.",
                    "Noll was replaced byBill Cowher, who led the Steelers to the playoffs in 10 of his 15 seasons with the team. One of Cowher’s most significant personnel moves was his promotion of secondary coachDick LeBeauto the position of defensive coordinator in 1995: in his two stints (1995–97, 2004–15) as the Steelers’ coordinator, LeBeau put togetherformidabledefenses that defined the Pittsburgh teams of those eras. The Steelers’ defense of the mid-1990s was highlighted by stars such as future Hall of Fame cornerback Rod Woodson and linebackers Greg Lloyd and Kevin Greene. Pittsburgh advanced to theSuper Bowl in 1996but lost to theDallas Cowboys.",

In 2009 the Steelers, under the leadership of second-year head coachMike Tomlin, beat theArizona Cardinalsin dramatic fashion to capture their record sixthSuper Bowlchampionship.

The team won 11 games the following year and advanced to the playoffs, where the Steelers lost toTom Bradyand theNew England Patriotsin the AFC championship game for the third time. Pittsburgh topped that regular-season performance in 2017 with 13 wins, which tied with three other teams for the most in the NFL. However, the Steelers were upset in the team’s opening playoff game.

A strong defense was a hallmark of the team, led by linebacker T.J. Watt, aperennialDefensive Player of the Year finalist (he won the award in 2021).

After several decades of informal, student-organized games that were tolerated by faculty as analternativeto more destructive rowdiness, the first intercollegiate football game was played on November 6, 1869, inNew Brunswick,New Jersey, between in-state rivalsPrincetonandRutgersaccording to rules adapted from those of the London Football Association. This soccer-style game became the dominant form as Columbia, Cornell,Yale, and a few other colleges in the Northeast took up the sport in the early 1870s, and in 1873 representatives from Princeton, Yale, and Rutgers met inNew York Cityto found the Intercollegiate Football Association and to adopt a common code. Conspicuously missing wasHarvard, the country’s premier university, whose team insisted on playing the so-called “Boston Game,” a cross between soccer and rugby. In May 1874, in the second of two matches withMcGill Universityof Montreal (the first was played by the rules of the Boston Game), Harvard’s players were introduced to the rugby game and immediately preferred it to their own. The following year, for Harvard’s first football contest with Yale, representatives of the two schools agreed on “concessionary rules” that were chiefly Harvard’s. When spectators (including Princeton students) as well as Yale players saw the advantages of the rugby style, the stage was set for a meeting in 1876 of representatives from Harvard, Yale,Princeton, andColumbiato form a newIntercollegiate Football Associationbased on rugby rules."

                    "(Read Walter Camp’s 1903 Britannica essay on football.)",
                    "Harvard made the firstbreachin rugby rules. Rejecting the traditional manner of putting the ball in play—players from both teams massed about the ball in a “scrummage,” or “scrum,” trying to kick it forward through the mass of players—Harvard opted for “heeling it out,” or kicking the ball backward to a teammate. The further transformation of English rugby into American football came chiefly through the efforts ofWalter Camp, who even during his lifetime was known as the “Father of American Football.” As an undergraduate and then a medical student at Yale, Camp played football from 1876 through 1881, but—more important—beginning in 1878, he dominated the rules committee for nearly three crucial decades. Two of Camp’s revisions in particular effectively created the gridiron game. The first, in 1880, further refined Harvard’s initialinnovation, abolishing the scrummage altogether in favor of ascrimmage, which awarded possession of the ball to one of the two teams. It was then put in play by heeling it out. (Snapping the ball with the hand became legal in 1890, though snapping with the foot continued as an option until 1913.)",
                    "The second crucial rule change was necessitated by the first. Camp’s more orderly manner of initiating play did not require the team in possession of the ball to give it up. After Princeton simply held the ball for an entire half in its 1880 and 1881 contests with Yale, both games ending in scoreless ties thatboredspectators as much as they frustrated Yale’s players, Camp proposed a rule that a team must advance the ball 5 yards or lose 10 in threedowns (plays), or it would be obliged to surrender the ball to the other side. Camp was also responsible for having 11 players on a side, for devising a new scoring system in 1883 with two points for atouchdown, four points for the goal after a touchdown, and five points for afield goal (a field goal became worth three points in 1909, a touchdown six points in 1912), for creating the quarterback position, for marking the field with stripes, and for proposing several otherinnovations, but it was those two simple rules adopted in 1880 and 1882 that most fundamentally created American football.",
                    "After the crucial rule changes, the play of the game was relatively open, featuring long runs and numerous lateral passes, as in rugby. In 1888 Camp proposed that tackling below the waist be legalized, in order to offset the advantage of speedy backs streaking around the ends. The new rule resulted in the rise of mass plays, an offensive strategy that massed players on a single point of the defense, most famously in Harvard’s “flying wedge” in 1892. This style of play proved so brutal that the game was nearlyabolishedin the 1890s and early 1900s."

After finding moderate success in the 1970s and then struggling throughout the early 1980s, the Penguins draftedMario Lemieuxin 1984, who was an instant offensive force on the ice and would become one of the greatest players in the history of the game. As the club drafted and traded for other standout players, the Penguins became a regular presence in the playoffs in the late 1980s. After the addition of right wingJaromir Jagr, they won both the 1991 and 1992 Stanley Cup championships.",

Following Lemieux’s initial retirement in 1997, Jagr became team captain and won the league scoring title four years in a row (from 1997–98 to 2000–01).",

In the 2007–08 season Crosby and second-year starEvgeni Malkin led the Penguins to the Stanley Cup finals, which they lost to theDetroit Red Wings.

That year the Penguins finished fourth in the Atlantic Division but advanced again to the Stanley Cup finals, this time defeating the Red Wings in seven games.",

However, the team failed to advance past theconferencefinals over that span, losing to a lower-seeded team in five of the six postseasons. The team broke through in 2015–16, ending the regular season on a hot streak that carried over into the postseason, during which the Penguins captured another Stanley Cup title (over theSan Jose Sharksin six games). The Penguins tallied the second most points in the NHL (111) in 2016–17, and in the postseason the team won seven-game series in both the second round and Eastern Conference finals to return to the Stanley Cup finals, where they faced theNashville Predators. The Penguins then defeated the Predators in six games, becoming the first NHL team to win consecutive Stanley Cups since 1998. Pittsburgh returned to the playoffs in 2018 but lost in the second round, and in 2019 the team was swept in its first-round series.

                    "Until the mid-1980s it was generally accepted that ice hockey derived from Englishfield hockeyand Indianlacrosseand was spread throughout Canada by British soldiers in the mid-1800s. Research then turned up mention of a hockeylike game, played in the early 1800s inNova Scotiaby theMi’kmaq(Micmac) Indians, which appeared to have been heavily influenced by the Irish game of hurling; it included the use of a “hurley” (stick) and a square wooden block instead of aball. It was probably fundamentally this game that spread throughout Canada via Scottish and Irish immigrants and the British army. The players adopted elements of field hockey, such as the “bully” (later the face-off) and “shinning” (hitting one’s opponent on the shins with the stick or playing with the stick on one “shin” or side); this evolved into an informal ice game later known asshinnyor shinty. The namehockey—as the organized game came to be known—has beenattributedto the French wordhoquet(shepherd’s stick). The termrink, referring to the designated area of play, was originally used in the game ofcurlingin 18th-century Scotland. Early hockey games allowed as many as 30 players a side on the ice, and the goals were two stones, each frozen into one end of the ice. The first use of a puck instead of a ball was recorded at Kingston Harbour, Ontario, Canada, in 1860."

                    "The first recorded public indoor ice hockey game, with rules largely borrowed from field hockey, took place in Montreal’s Victoria Skating Rink in 1875 between two teams ofMcGill Universitystudents. Unfortunately, the reputation for violence that the game would later develop was presaged in this earlyencounter, where, asThe Daily British WhigofKingston, Ontario, reported, “Shins and heads were battered, benches smashed and the lady spectators fled in confusion.” The first organized team, theMcGill University Hockey Club, formed in 1877, codified their game’s rules and limited the number of players on a side to nine.",
                    "By the late 1800s ice hockey competed with lacrosse as Canada’s most popular sport. The first national hockey organization, theAmateur Hockey Association (AHA) of Canada (which limited players to seven a side), was formed inMontrealin 1885, and the first league was formed in Kingston during the same year, with four teams: the Kingston Hockey Club,Queen’s University, the Kingston Athletics, and the Royal Military College. Queen’s University scored a 3–1 victory over the Athletics in the first championship game.",
                    "By the opening of the 20th century, sticks were being manufactured, shin pads were worn, the goaltender began to wear a chest protector (borrowed from baseball), and arenas (still with natural ice and no heat for spectators) were being constructed throughout eastern Canada. In 1893 national attention was focused on the game when the Canadian governor-general,Frederick Arthur, Lord Stanley of Preston, donated a cup to be given annually to the top Canadian team. The three-foot-high silver cup became known as theStanley Cupand was first awarded in 1892–93. (The first winner was theMontreal Amateur Athletic Association team, which also captured the Stanley Cup the following season by winning the initial challenge series to determine the Cup holder, which was the Cup-awarding format that Lord Stanley originally intended.) Since 1926 the cup has gone to the winner of theNational Hockey Leagueplay-offs.",
                    "In 1899 theCanadian Amateur Hockey League was formed. All hockey in Canada at the time was “amateur,” it being “ungentlemanly” to admit to being paid for athletic services. Thus, the first acknowledged professional hockey team in the world was formed in theUnited States, in 1903, in Houghton, Michigan. The team, thePortage Lakers, was owned by a dentist namedJ.L. Gibson, who imported Canadian players. In 1904 Gibson formed the first acknowledged professional league, theInternational Pro Hockey League. Canada accepted professional hockey in 1908 when theOntario Professional Hockey League was formed. By that time Canada had become the centre of world hockey."

                    "TheNational Hockey Association (NHA), the forerunner of the National Hockey League (NHL), was organized in 1910 and became the strongest hockey association inNorth America. Rising interest in the game created problems, however, for there were few artificial-ice rinks. In 1911 thePacific Coast Hockey Association(PCHA) was formed by Joseph Patrick and his sons, who built two enclosed artificial-ice arenas, beginning a boom in the construction of artificial-ice rinks.",
                    "The PCHA became involved in a money and player war with the NHA. Although the NHA ultimately emerged as the stronger league, it was the PCHA that introduced many of the changes that improved the game. The only radical rule change adopted by the NHA was to reduce the number of players on a side to six, and that move was made to save money. The western league retained seven-man hockey, but it allowed the goalie to leap ordiveto stop the puck. Under the previous rules, a goalie had had to remain stationary when making a save. The western league also changed the offside rule. Under the old rules, a player had been deemed offside if he was ahead of the puck carrier when he received a pass. The PCHA divided the ice into three zones by painting two blue lines across the surface and allowed forward passing in the centre zone between the blue lines. This opened up the game and made it more exciting. Anotherinnovationin the western league was the idea of the assist. Previously, only the goal scorer had been credited with a point. In the PCHA the player or players who set up his goal were credited with an assist. The first numbered uniforms also appeared in their league."
