Many of the underlying issues remained unresolved by the later peace treaties leaving the potential for future conflicts to occur.

It had been the usual practise of previous paymasters to appropriate to themselves the interest of all money lying in their hands by way of advance, and also to accept a commission of1⁄2% on all foreign subsidies. Although there was no strong public sentiment against the practice, Pitt completely refused to profit by it. All advances were lodged by him in theBank of Englanduntil required, and all subsidies were paid over without deduction, even though it was pressed upon him, so that he did not draw ashillingfrom his office beyond thesalarylegally attaching to it.[18]Pitt ostentatiously made this clear to everyone, although he was in fact following whatHenry Pelhamhad done when he had held the post between 1730 and 1743.

When in June 1756Menorca fellaftera failed attemptbyAdmiral Byngto relieve it, Pitt's allegations fuelled the public anger against Newcastle, leading him to be attacked by a mob inGreenwich.[44]The loss of Menorca shattered public faith in Newcastle, and forced him to step down as prime minister in November 1756."

Newfoundland was at the time seen as possessing huge economic and strategic value because of the extensive fishing industry there.[61]",
                    "The war in Germany continued through 1761 with the French again attempting to overcome Brunswick and invade Hanover, but suffering a defeat at theBattle of Villinghausen. Pitt had substantially increased the number of British troops serving with Brunswick, and he also planned further conquests in the West Indies. A strategy he hoped would compel the French to conclude a reasonable peace treaty."

When the treaty was discussed in parliament in December of the previous year, although suffering from a severe attack of gout, he was carried down to the House, and in a speech of three hours' duration, interrupted more than once by paroxysms of pain, he strongly protested against its various conditions.[62]These conditions included the return of the sugar islands (but Britain retainedDominica); trading stations in West Africa (won by Boscawen);Pondicherry(France's Indian colony); and fishing rights inNewfoundland. Pitt's opposition arose through two heads: France had been given the means to become once more formidable at sea, whilstFrederick of Prussiahad been betrayed.",
                    "Pitt believed that the task had been left half-finished and called for a final year of war which would crush French power for good. Pitt had long-held plans for further conquests which had been uncompleted. Newcastle, by contrast, sought peace but only if the war in Germany could be brought to an honourable and satisfactory conclusion (rather than Britain suddenly bailing out of it as Bute proposed). However the combined opposition of Newcastle and Pitt was not enough to prevent the Treaty passing comfortably in both Houses of Parliament.",
                    "However, there were strong reasons for concluding the peace: the National Debt had increased from £74.5m. in 1755 to £133.25m. in 1763, the year of thepeace. The requirement to pay down this debt, and the lack of French threat in Canada, were major movers in the subsequentAmerican War of Independence.",
                    "The physical cause which rendered this effort so painful probably accounts for the infrequency of his appearances in parliament, as well as for much that is otherwise inexplicable in his subsequent conduct. In 1763, he spoke against the unpopulartax on cider, imposed by his brother-in-law,George Grenville, and his opposition, although unsuccessful in the House, helped to keep alive his popularity with the country, which cordially hated theexciseand all connected with it. When next year the question ofgeneral warrantswas raised in connexion with the case ofJohn Wilkes, Pitt vigorously maintained their illegality, thus defending at once the privileges of Parliament and thefreedom of the press.[62]",
                    "During 1765 he seems to have been totallyincapacitatedfor public business. In the following year he supported with great power the proposal of theRockinghamadministration for the repeal of theStamp Act, arguing that it was unconstitutional to impose taxes upon the colonies. He thus endorsed the contention of the colonists on the ground of principle, while the majority of those who acted with him contented themselves with resisting the disastrous taxation scheme on the ground of expediency.[62]",

Thus the House of Commons repudiated in the most formal manner the principle Pitt laid down. His language in approval of the resistance of the colonists was unusually bold, and perhaps no one but himself could have employed it with impunity at a time when the freedom of debate was only imperfectly conceded.[62][63]",

Unsuccessful overtures were made to him in 1763, and twice in 1765, in May and June—the negotiator in May being the king's uncle, theDuke of Cumberland, who went down in person toHayes, Pitt's seat inKent. It is known that he had the opportunity of joining the Marquess of Rockingham's short-lived administration at any time on his own terms, and his conduct in declining an arrangement with that minister has been more generally condemned than any other step in his public life.[62]"

He inspired trust in his chosen commanders by his indifference to rules of seniority—several of \"Pitt's boys\", likeKeppel, captor ofGorée, were in their thirties—and by his clear orders.[65]It was his discernment that selected Wolfe to lead the attack onQuebec, and gave him the opportunity of dying a victor on theheights of Abraham. He had personally less to do with the successes in India than with the other great enterprises that shed an undying lustre on his administration; but his generous praise in parliament encouragedRobert Clive, and the forces that acted at the close of the struggle were animated by his indomitable spirit.[40]",
                "Pitt's particular genius was to finance an army on the continent to drain French men and resources so that Britain might concentrate on what he held to be the vital spheres: Canada and theWest Indies; whilst Clive successfully defeatedSiraj ud-Daulah, (the last independentNawab of Bengal) atPlassey(1757), securing India. The Continental campaign was carried on byCumberland, defeated atHastenbeckand forced to surrender atConvention of Klosterzeven(1757) and thereafter byFerdinand of Brunswick, later victor atMinden; Britain's Continental campaign had two major strands, firstly subsidising allies, particularly Frederick the Great, and second, financing an army to divert French resources from the colonial war and to also defend Hanover (which was the territory of the Kings of England at this time)",
                "Pitt was a leading imperialist in English history. He was the directing mind in the expansion of his country, and with him the beginning of empire is rightly associated. TheSeven Years' Warmight well, moreover, have been anotherThirty Years' Warif Pitt had not furnished Frederick with an annual subsidy of £700,000, and in addition relieved him of the task of defending western Germany against France:[40]this was the policy that allowed Pitt to boast of having \"won Canada on the banks of the Rhine\".",
                "Contemporary opinion was, of course, incompetent to estimate the permanent results gained for the country by the brilliant foreign policy of Pitt. It has long been generally agreed that by several of his most costly expeditions nothing was really won but glory: the policy of diversionary attacks on places likeRochefortwas memorably described as 'breaking windows with gold guineas'. It has even been said that the only permanent acquisition that England owed directly to him was her Canadian dominion; and, strictly speaking, this is true, it being admitted that the campaign by which the Indian empire was virtually won was not planned by him, although brought to a successful issue during his ministry.[40]",
                "But materialaggrandisement, although the only tangible, was not the only real or lasting effect of a war policy. More could be gained by crushing a formidable rival than by conquering a province. The loss of her Canadian possessions was only one of a series of disasters suffered by France, which included the victories at sea ofBoscawenatLagosandHawkeatQuiberon Bay. Such defeats radically affected the future of Europe and the world. Deprived of her most valuable colonies both in theEastand in theWest, and thoroughly defeated on the continent, France's humiliation was the beginning of a new epoch in history.[40]",
                "The victorious policy of Pitt destroyed the military prestige which repeated experience has shown to be in France as in no other country the very life of monarchy, and thus was not the least of the influences that slowly brought about theFrench Revolution. It effectually deprived France of the lead in the councils of Europe which she had hitherto arrogated to herself, and so affected the whole course of continental politics. It is such far-reaching results as these, and not the mere acquisition of a single colony, however valuable, that constitute Pitt's claim to be considered as the most powerful minister that ever guided the foreign policy of England.[40]"

Equally they may have believed that the British had become overstretched by fighting a global war and decided to try to seizeBritish possessionssuch asJamaica.

He warded off the evil hour that seemed approaching, he infused vigour into our arms, he taught the nation to speak again as England used to speak to foreign powers  ... Pitt, on entering upon administration, had found the nation at the lowest ebb in point of power and reputation  ... France, who meant to be feared, was feared heartily  ... They were willing to trust that France would be so good as to ruin us by inches. Pitt had roused us from this ignoble lethargy  ... The admirers of Mr Pitt extol the reverberation he gave to our councils, the despondence he banished, the spirit he infused, the conquests he made, the security he affixed to our trade and plantations, the humiliation of France, the glory of Britain carried under his administration to a pitch at which it never had arrived—and all this is exactly true.[82]",
            "Samuel Johnsonis reported to have said that \"Walpole was a minister given by the king to the people, but Pitt was a minister given by the people to the king\", and the remark correctly indicated Chatham's distinctive place among English statesmen. He was the first minister whose main strength lay in the support of the nation at large as distinct from its representatives in the Commons, where his personal following was always small. He was the first to discern that public opinion, though generally slow to form and slow to act, is in the end the paramount power in the state; and he was the first to use it not in an emergency merely, but throughout a whole political career.[73]",
            "Chatham marked the commencement of that vast change in the movement ofEnglish politicsby which it came about that the sentiment of the great mass of the people then told effectively on the action of the government from day to day—almost from hour to hour. He was well fitted to secure the sympathy and admiration of his countrymen, for his virtues and his failings were alike English. He was often inconsistent, he was generally intractable and overbearing, and he was always pompous and affected to a degree which, asMacaulayremarked, seemed scarcely compatible with true greatness.[73]",
            "Of the last quality evidence was furnished in the stilted style of his letters, and in the fact recorded byThomas Sewardthat he never permitted his under-secretaries to sit in his presence. Burke spoke of \"some significant, pompous, creeping, explanatory, ambiguous matter, in the true Chathamic style\". But these defects were known only to the inner circle of his associates.[73][83]",
            "To the outside public he was endeared as a statesman who could do or suffer \"nothing base\", and who had the rare power of transfusing his own indomitable energy and courage into all who served under him. \"A spirited foreign policy\" has always been popular in England, and Pitt was the most popular of English ministers, because he was the most successful exponent of such a policy. In domestic affairs his influence was small and almost entirely indirect. He himself confessed his unfitness for dealing with questions of finance. The commercial prosperity that was produced by his war policy was in a great part delusive, as prosperity so produced must always be, although it had permanent effects of the highest moment in the rise of such centres of industry as Glasgow. This, however, was a remote result which he could have neither intended nor foreseen.[73]",
            "It has been suggested that Pitt was in fact a far more orthodox Whig than has been historically portrayed demonstrated by his sitting for rotten borough seats controlled by aristocratic magnates, and his lifelong concern for protecting thebalance of poweron the European continent, which marked him out from many other Patriots.[84]",
