            "The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania[19]by theScottish-Americanindustrialist and philanthropistAndrew Carnegie, who wrote \"My heart is in the work\", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by thePratt InstituteinBrooklyn, New York, founded by industrialistCharles Prattin 1887.[20]In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time, CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and theMargaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women.",
            "TheMellon Institute of Industrial Researchwas founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothersAndrew Mellon(who went on to becomeU.S. Treasury Secretary) andRichard B. Mellonin honor of their father,Thomas Mellon, patriarch of theMellon family. The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as a department within theUniversity of Pittsburgh. In 1927, the Mellon Institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute's iconic building was completed on Fifth Avenue.[21]",
            "In 1967, with support fromPaul Mellon, the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. In 1973, Carnegie Mellon's coordinatewomen's college, the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, merged its academic programs with the rest of the university.[22]The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. In 2001, CMRI's programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities.[23]"

Carnegie Mellon owns 81 buildings in theOaklandandSquirrel Hillneighborhoods of Pittsburgh.",
                "For decades, the center of student life on campus was Skibo Hall, the university's student union. Built in the 1950s, Skibo Hall's design was typical ofmid-century modernarchitecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity. The original Skibo Hall was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully Wi-Fi enabled. Known as the University Center, the building was dedicated in 1996. In 2014, Carnegie Mellon re-dedicated the University Center as the Cohon University Center in recognition of the eighth president of the university,Jared Cohon.[24]",
                "A large grassy area known as \"The Cut\" forms the backbone of the campus, with a separate grassy area known as \"The Mall\" running perpendicular. The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine (hence the name) with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building.",

                "There was little change to the campus between thefirstandsecond World War. A 1938 master plan by Githens andKeallysuggested acquisition of new land alongForbes Avenue, but the plan was not fully implemented. The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts building (former home of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration) in 1952 and ending with Wean Hall in 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University. New facilities were needed to respond to the university's growing national reputation inartificial intelligence, business, robotics and the arts. In addition, an expanding student population demanded improved facilities for student life, athletics and libraries. The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land alongSchenley Park.",
                "The buildings of this era reflected contemporary architectural styles. TheInternational Style, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in European settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie Mellon campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among American universities to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, the International Style was adopted to accomplish needed expansion quickly and affordably with the swelling of student ranks in the aftermath of theGI Billin 1944. Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.",
                "During the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of presidentRichard Cyert(1972–1990) witnessed a period of growth and development. The research budget grew from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s. Researchers in new fields likeroboticsandsoftware engineeringhelped the university to build its reputation. One example was the introduction of the \"Andrew\" computing network in the mid-1980s. This project linking all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a technology leader in education and research. On April 24, 1985,cmu.edu, Carnegie Mellon's Internet domain, became one of thefirst six.edudomain names."

Through the establishment of programs and centers outside the limitations of departments or colleges, the university has established leadership in fields such ascomputational finance,information systems,cognitive sciences, management, arts management, product design,behavioral economics, energy science and economics,human–computer interaction,entertainment technology, anddecision science. Within the past two decades, the university has built a new university center (Cohon University Center), theater and drama building (Purnell Center for the Arts), business school building (Tepper School of Business), and several dormitories.

                "In the early days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge connecting Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge was a meeting place for students. In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area. The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence. The administration was about to give up and tear it down, but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition.[156]The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as \"the Cut\". Students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may \"take\" the fence. The fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6 am. Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered \"the world's most painted object\" by theGuinness Book of World Records.[157]"
