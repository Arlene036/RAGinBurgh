Yudell is a principal of Moore Ruble Yudell Architects and Planners of Santa Monica, Calif.“As a design team, there’s nothing more exciting than to make a physical place that supports, enhances and nurtures the ongoing vision and mission for the school and the university. We’re designing for today, and 10, 20 years from now,” he said.",
                    "Yudell outlined several key principles the team used to shape their work. Among them were creating a hub for campus; enlivening campus life with mixed uses; energizing collaboration and innovation; creating domains for undergraduate and graduate students; and integrating technology to support the delivery of curricula.",

                    "“We wanted to use the original palette and push it forward,” Yudell said of the yellow brick. “We can use the prevailing materials in a new way to connect to the history and still push it forward.”",
                    "He said by using the architectural history of the university, the building speaks to visitors, in a way, telling them that they’re in a beautiful setting and entering into the CMU district.",
                    "Interior spaces will be flooded with natural light, warm fabric furnishings and wood to promote collaboration and interaction. Yudell said the inside would be lively, even the stairways. He called the wide ergonomically sound stairways, “social stairs” that encourage people to be active.",

                    "The second floor, accessible from the entrance facing the Cut, will include several dining options, such as grab & go and various cooking stations.",
                    "“Food is central to the life of a building,” Yudell said.",
                    "Levels two and three will contain 18 classrooms and flexible academic support spaces, an undergraduate and graduate student commons area, breakout rooms and collaborative areas, and an Entrepreneurship Center. Classrooms will be equipped with technology for production and linking to CMU campuses around the globe.",
                    "The fourth and fifth floors will be used for faculty, Ph.D. and staff offices and meeting space. Yudell said there would be a “faculty neighborhood” instead of a faculty lounge.",
                    "“Faculty have given up having a faculty lounge in favor of having spaces between offices to become part of a mixing bowl to generate interaction and make it a unique place,” he said.",

So, in having this central location, we can better support students to be their full selves.” Gilbride-Brown said among the offerings of the center are resources related to race, ethnicity, first in family, men and masculinity, feminism, women, gender expression and LGBTQ.",

                "“We hope that the center will be a space for students to feel connected to one another and to the university,” said Hippensteel, who is interim director and coordinator of the Office of Title IX Initiatives. “It is exciting to be able to bridge relationships and amplify opportunities for collaboration that serve a common goal, which is for all of us to be able to truly experience the benefits of the diverse educational environment that we have — and that we continue to grow — at Carnegie Mellon.”",

                    "SCS has created the new AI degree, the first offered by a U.S. university, in response to extraordinary technical breakthroughs in AI and the growing demand by students and employers for training that prepares people for careers in AI.",
                    "\"Specialists in artificial intelligence have never been more important, in shorter supply or in greater demand by employers,\" said Andrew Moore, dean of the School of Computer Science. \"Carnegie Mellon has an unmatched depth of expertise in AI, making us uniquely qualified to address this need for graduates who understand how the power of AI can be leveraged to help people.\"",
                    "U.S. News and World Report this spring ranked SCS as the No. 1 graduate school for artificial intelligence.",
                    "The bachelor's degree program in computer science teaches students to think broadly about methods that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks across many disciplines, noted Reid Simmons, research professor of robotics and computer science and director of the new AI degree program. The bachelor's degree in AI will focus more on how complex inputs, such as vision, language and huge databases, are used to make decisions or enhance human capabilities, he added. AI majors will receive the same solid grounding in computer science and math courses as other computer science students. In addition, they will have additional course work in AI-related subjectsstatistics and probability, computational modeling, machine learning and symbolic computation.",
                    "Simmons said the program also would include a strong emphasis on ethics and social responsibility. This will include independent study opportunities in using AI for social good, such as improving transportation, health care or education.",
                    "Students accepted by SCS as first-year students will be able to enter the AI degree program in their second year. All students thus will be able to take first-year courses in core computer science competencies and introductory courses. This will enable them to make informed choices when it is time to declare a major, whether it's AI,computer scienceorcomputational biology, the latter an undergraduate degree program that began in fall 2017.",
                    "Initially, AI undergraduate enrollment will accommodate no more than 100 second-, third- and fourth-year students — or about 30-35 new students each year. SCS enrolls about 735 undergraduates. In fall 2018, a limited number of second- and third-year students who have already taken a substantial number of relevant courses can apply to join the new AI degree program.",
                    "Just as artificial intelligence unites such disciplines as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics and human-computer interaction, instruction in the AI program will draw on the faculty of SCS'sMachine Learning Department,Language Technologies Institute,Robotics Institute,Human-Computer Interaction Institute,Institute for Software ResearchandComputer Science Department.",
                    "The degree will leverage CMU's traditional strength in cross-disciplinary instruction, particularly in exploring the ethical and societal implications of AI, by involving faculty members from theDietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, theHeinz College of Information Systems and Public Policyand theCollege of Engineering.",
                    "CMU has a long history in artificial intelligence, including the creation of the first AI computer program in 1956 and pioneering work in self-driving cars, facial recognition and natural language processing. Last year, SCS began its CMU AI research and education initiative, which involves almost 200 faculty members working in AI-related areas that range from art to public policy.",
                    "CMU also has been a leader in education, offering the first university-level course in computer programming in 1958, launching the first Ph.D. program in robotics and creating the world's first Machine Learning Department. SCS will once again advance computer science education through its AI degree program, said Simmons, who is completing a 2 1/2-year stint as program director in the National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate and lead for the National Robotics Initiative.",
                    "\"It's an opportunity for us to shape what it means to be a degree program in AI, as opposed to offering courses related to AI,\" Simmons said. The new program will employ the same academic rigor — no more, no less — that has made CMU's undergraduate program the gold standard for computer science.",
                    "\"We want to be the first to offer an AI undergraduate degree,\" he continued. \"I'm sure we won't be the last. AI is here to stay.\"",
