    "introduction": "TheNationality Roomsare a group of 31 classrooms in theUniversity of Pittsburgh'sCathedral of Learningdepicting and donated by the national and ethnic groups that helped build the city ofPittsburgh. The rooms are designated as aPittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundationhistorical landmark and are located on the 1st and 3rd floors of the Cathedral of Learning, itself a national historic landmark,[4][5]on theUniversity of Pittsburgh's main campus in theOaklandneighborhood ofPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Although of museum caliber, 29 of the 31 rooms are used as daily classrooms by University of Pittsburgh faculty and students, while the other two (the Early American and Syrian-Lebanon) are display rooms viewed through glass doors, utilized primarily for special events, and can only be explored via special guided tour. The Nationality Rooms also serve in a vigorous program of intercultural involvement and exchange in which the original organizing committees for the rooms remain as participants and which includes a program of annual student scholarship to facilitate study abroad.[6]In addition, the Nationality Rooms inspire lectures, seminars, concerts exhibitions, and social events which focus on the various heritages and traditions of the nations represented. The national, traditional, and religious holidays of the nations represented are celebrated on campus and the rooms are appropriately decorated to reflect these occasions. The Nationality Rooms are available daily for public tours as long as the particular room is not being used for a class or other university function.[7]",

        "content": [
            "The Nationality Room Program was founded byRuth Crawford Mitchellat the request of PittChancellor John Bowmanin 1926, in order to involve the community in constructing theCathedral of Learningand to provide the spiritual and symbolic foundation of the Cathedral that would make the inside of the building as inspiring and impressive as the outside. Under Mitchell's direction, invitations were extended to national communities in the Pittsburgh area to sponsor a room that was representative of their heritage. Each group formed a Room Committee responsible for fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The university provided the room and upkeep in perpetuity once completed, while all other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes partly provided for by foreign governments which, \"...responded with generous support, often providing architects, artists, materials, and monetary gifts to assure authenticity and superb quality in their classrooms.\"[8]Each room is carefully designed and executed down to the switch plates, door handles, hinges, and wastebaskets. The work is often performed and designed by native artists and craftsmen and involves imported artifacts and materials.  Mitchell remained Director of the Nationality Rooms program until 1956, having overseen the creation of the first 19 rooms on the first floor of the cathedral.  A successor to Mitchell wasn't named until 1965 when E. Maxine Bruhns took over the program, overseeing the completion of twelve additional rooms on the third floor. Bruhns retired on Jan. 1, 2020, after 54 years in the position, and died in July 2020.[9][10]",
            "A typical room on the 1st floor built between 1938 and 1957 took between three and ten years to complete, and would have cost the equivalent of $453,417 today, which was no small undertaking, especially considering that the fundraising and construction of the initial rooms took place during theGreat DepressionandWorld War II.  More recent rooms have cost in the range of US$750,000 and up, and took up to ten years to complete.[11]Upon completion of their rooms, the committees turn to a program of intercultural exchange and fundraising for nationality rooms scholarships which enable University of Pittsburgh students and faculty to study abroad.  The room committees also sponsor cultural and fundraising events, lectures, concerts, exhibits, social events, and workshops on ethnic studies that may utilize the rooms.  The committee may use its room for non-political meetings, lectures, or other functions if no classes are scheduled. Distinguished international visitors are received by the committees, and special projects are undertaken including the purchase of books for theUniversity libraries, publication of volumes on topics from comparative literature to ethnic recipes, and the fostering of courses in the mother languages.  National, traditional, and religious holidays are celebrated on campus, and committees decorate their rooms or mount displays to commemorate special occasions.",
            "The first four rooms to be dedicated were theScottish,Russian,German, andSwedishRooms in 1938.\"[12]The newest rooms are theTurkishandSwissrooms, both dedicated in 2012,[13][14]theKoreanroom dedicated in 2015,[15]and the Philippine Room dedicated in 2019.[16]",
            "Original plans also proposed, in addition to the Nationality Rooms on the first floor, the creation of \"Pennsylvania\" classrooms on the second floor to be dedicated to the pioneering groups within the state along with third floor \"Pittsburgh\" classrooms dedicated to showcasing the history of theWestern Pennsylvaniaor different eras of American history.[17][18]Although the plans for the series of rooms were drawn up, only one room was installed, theEarly AmericanClassroom, which is now counted among the other Nationality Rooms. The plans for the other Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania rooms were never executed, and the Nationality Room program grew to occupy all of the first and much of the third floor.",
            "Upon completion of a room, a dedication ceremony is held with a formal presentation of a ceremonial key to the university's Chancellor to symbolize the bestowal and acceptance of the gift, and a commitment by the university to maintain the room in perpetuity. The nationality room committee officers then become members of the Nationality Council which provides scholarships for summer study abroad for Pitt students, along with other non-political cultural or educational events within the Nationality Program's scope. Today,[as of?]the cathedral is home to 31 Nationality Rooms (29 working classrooms and two display rooms: theEarly AmericanRoom and theSyrian-LebanonRoom), on the first and third floors. Each nationality room celebrates a different culture that influenced Pittsburgh's growth, depicting an era prior to 1787, the university's founding and the signing of theUnited States Constitution. Only one room does not follow this convention, with theFrenchClassroom depicting theFirst French Empireof the early 19th century. There are two additional rooms in the process of being approved and funded.[citation needed]",
            "Set in the Cathedral of Learning's cornerstone in 1937 is a gift from the Nationality Room Committee chairpersons to the university: a copper plate engraved with these thoughts:",
            "Since 1944, tours of the nationality rooms have been given to visitors by a Pitt student organization,Quo Vadis(Latin:Where do you go?), that guides over 40,000 tourists a year. With reservations, specially themed tours based on creature symbolism, images of royalty, and folktales are also given. An estimated 100,000 visitors, including self-guided and walk-in tourists, visit the Nationality Rooms each year."

        "content": [
            "The following principles, in order to assure commonality of purpose, authenticity, and non-political cultural emphasis, governed the creation of nationality rooms from the programs inception in 1926 until the completion of the Irish Classroom in 1957.",
            "In the 1970s, policy revisions were implemented which retaining most of the earlier principles, utilized a broader definition of nation to include a body of people associated with a particular territory and possessing a distinctive cultural and social way of life.  This allowed the creation of the Armenian and Ukrainian rooms prior to their establishment as independent nations following the collapse of theSoviet Union, as well as allowing for the installation of the African Heritage Room.",
            "The room must also be a functional teaching classroom with enough student tablet-armed seats, professor's lectern or table, adequate sight lines and lighting, modern audiovisual technology, and other necessities of a classroom.  New rooms also have narrated tour equipment. Materials are to remain authentic and durable that are executed through architectural form and not mere surface embellishment and are to provide eternal qualities that have the potential to \"teach\" about the cultures with appropriate non-political symbols and artifacts."

The kitchen-living room of the early colonists was chosen to portray the sturdy simplicity of life in America during the 1650s.[21]The room's focus is a nine-foot fireplace constructed from 200-year-old handmade bricks with \"fixings\" of a log hook, heavy iron kettles, a spider, gridiron, longhandled waffle iron, bread shovel, skewers, ladles, and forks. A small recess in the brick wall served to bake bread.

                "The Japanese Nationality Room celebrates traditional Japanese carpentry and woodcraft, evoking the mid-18th centuryminkawhich were houses of the non-ruling classes of Japan. This room is representative of minka that might be the residence of an important village leader in a farm village on the outskirts ofKyotoand the design represents the core rooms of the house: a plank-floored ima or household sitting room and the adjacent doma, an area with a compacted earthen floor used as an entry-way, for cooking and as a work space. The doma was also a space for household life, where farm, business and craft activities could be carried out under a roof. In the past it also provided a place for drying grain during rainy weather. A central feature of the room is the massive, rough-hewn beam, the ushibari of Japanesepine, supported by posts at the boundary of the ima and doma elements of the room.  The main beam in this room had been carefully preserved by the carpenters in Japan for many years until a project could be found to appropriately utilize its unique curvature. To accommodate the weight concentrated on the primary post, the daikokubashira, the layout of the room has been designed so that this main post sits directly above the building's existing superstructure. The major posts are made ofzelkova, (keyaki), a hardwood with a distinctive grain pattern. The other beams are made of American pine. The posts and beams are connected without nails, using traditional joinery techniques. The ceiling is ofbamboowith joined beams which would have allowed for the circulation of warm air from fireplaces below.  The walls mimics the typical mud plaster walls through the use of textured wallpaper and woodenwainscotingfor greater durability. The bay window is a structure not in keeping with traditional Japanese design and has been masked with panels that suggest shôji, sliding doors of lattice frames, covered with translucent paper. The ima is suggested with a plank wood floor covering the largest portion of the room.  The floor toward the front of the room is made of a simulated earthen material to represent a portion of the doma where it meets the ima's wooden floor. Although the traditional design would call for the wooden floor to be much higher than the dirt floor, this feature has been eliminated in the classroom for practicality.  Located on the rear wall, is thetokonoma, a raised alcove for the display of treasured objects, flower arrangements, and seasonal decorations. The tokonoma has been built in shoin-style, with shôji along its exterior side. The corner post, tokobashira, is made ofebonyand the floor of the tokonoma istatami. The display cases at the rear of the room and along the interior wall contain artifacts in keeping with the period and include achagamaandfuro, an iron kettle with metal charcoal hearth/brazier combination, used in the \"tea ceremony\". While typical minka would have no chairs at all, in keeping with its function as a classroom, the classroom has wooden chairs designed and crafted specifically for students and are consistent in design with the rest of the room. Sliding wooden panels cover the blackboard at the front of the room. The interior surface of the entry door has been modified with a wooden treatment that suggests the sliding door that was the typical entrance to a house of this period.[41]"

The main room attempts to convey the theme of democracy with its seating distributed around the perimeter of the room which suggests that all occupants are equals. Hardwood seats mimicdivan-style seating found in a typical baş odası with back panels that function as writing tablets which when retracted form a \"parted curtain\" motif, a common shape used for household wall niches. The room's ceiling, modeled after the Emirhocazade Ahmet Bey summer house inSafranbolu, is a combination of traditional çitakâri and kündekâri carpentry art that creates intricate geometric patterns using small pieces of wood attached without metal fasteners or glue. Clear glass windows along one wall frame a painted mural depicting a panoramic view of Istanbul which is feature similar to that seen in the mirrored room of theTopkapi Palace. The stained glass windows depict a tulip shape which served as a symbol of the Ottomans in the 18th century.  Display cases contain historic examples ofTurkish calligraphy, ceramics, jewelry, miniatures and textiles as well as anevil eye. The entrance symbol above the exterior door depicts the currentflag of Turkey, adopted in 1936."

                "The Welsh Classroom, was perhaps the longest in coming, as reservations for a Welsh room were originally requested in the 1930s.[63]The existing room, installed on the third floor of the Cathedral of Learning, is patterned after the Pen-rhiw Chapel atSt Fagans National History MuseumnearCardiffand represents a traditional 18th-century Welsh chapel, which often became the center of village social life.[64]By that time, the English ruled the country and imposed law requiring English as the official language of the courts and churches.  In order to worship and hold church services in their nativeWelsh language, and spurred on by the non-conformist movement started by theProtestant Reformation, the Welsh people met in secret locations such as barns or homes, as suggested by the simple white walled chapel modeled in this Nationality Room.  The minister would live at one end as depicted by the display case with dishes and pottery that would be found in a Welsh kitchen and the long oak case clock seated on aWelsh slatefoundation opposite the main blue door.  The clock, considered one of the most important furnishings in a Welsh home, has, instead of numbers, a painted square face that spells out \"Richard Thomas\" suggesting that he was both the maker and owner of the clock. The bay window serves as the focus of the Welsh chapel worship, including a blue raised pulpit with a view of the entire congregation and two Deacon's benches from which to monitor the actions of the minister and congregation.",
                "At the other end of the room is a table bearing a lectern, as such worship places would often become a school room for both children and adults during week days.  Above the chalk board is theLord's Prayer, written in Welsh.[65]Pew benches ofpineface the lectern.  Along the wall, larger and more comfortable blue-painted pew boxes with wooden floors, often also serving as barn cattle stalls, would have served wealthier families who would sometimes bring straw, blankets, hot bricks, or dogs to keep them warm. To reflect the simplicity of such meeting places, the ceiling beams are made ofpoplarand flooring suggests a typical chapel dirt floor.  The carved stone dragon over the doorway, the long-timeWelsh national symbol, represents the legendary victory of theRed Dragonover the White Dragon of numerous tales ofmedieval Welsh literatureand represents the triumph of Good over Evil.[66][67][68]"

The walls are paneled inSlavonianoak and hand-carved with geometric figures and the old Slavonic heart design which is combined with a running geometric border, a favorite withSouth Slavs.  This type of work, known as \"notch-carving\", was traditionally done with a penknife as pastime of peasants.  On the corridor wall is a specially designed coat of arms featuring a double-headed eagle symbolizing the religious influences of EasternEmpire of Byzantiumand WesternEmpire of Romealong with the founding dates of the universities inBelgrade,Ljubljana, andZagreb.  The ceiling is carved with intricateCroatian,Slovenian, andSerbianfolk motifs and the wooden chandeliers are similar to those in theWhite Palacein Belgrade. The professor's chair and guests chairs were carved by students at the International Art School in Zagreb, and each spindle of the chairs bears a different notched design.  At the window, a bronze sculpture by Vojta Braniš, \"Post-War Motherhood\", depicts a barefoot mother nursing her child whom she has protected during the long months of war.  In the display cabinet is a lace portrayal of theMadonnaof Brežje by Slovenes Leopoldina Pelhan and her student Mila Božičkova which took six months to complete and was inspired by the story of a lace Madonna created by the villagers ofSveta Gorain order to replace a priceless painting duringWorld War I.[69]The ceiling squares contain one of the three alternating ceiling ornaments suggesting flowers, stars, the sun, and other radiating geometric patterns, which are organized into a matrix of 9 by 7 squares.",

On the corridor wall are likenesses ofBaron George von Vega(1754–1802), a Slovenian officer in theAustrianarmy and mathematician recognized for various works including a book of logarithm tables; andPetar Petrović Njegoš(1813–1851), the last prince-bishop ofMontenegro, who was celebrated for his poetry.  Represented on the rear wall areRugjer Bošković(1711–1787), a Croatian scientist distinguished for his achievements in the fields of mathematics, optics, and astronomy; andFrance Ksaver Prešeren(1800–1849) who is considered one of the greatest native-language Slovenian poets.",

After his death in September 1933 the new chairman was Steve Babić, the previous vice-chairman, and the new vice-chairwoman became Catherine Rušković McAleer. Famous Croatian sculptorIvan Meštrovićwas a great supporter of the Classroom and gave two of his works to the university, one a bust ofMihajlo Pupinand the other a self-portrait.[70]The Classroom was designed to portray the culture and traditions of theYugoslavs, who were considered as inhabitants of the variousYugoslavian regions:Croatians,Dalmatians,Slavonians,Slovenians,Serbians,BosniansandMontenegrins.[71]"
