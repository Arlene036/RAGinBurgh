            "Today's museum began as an eleven-room, Italianate-style house purchased by the Fricks shortly after their marriage in 1881.  The house was built in the 1860s, original architect unknown.  After modifications by Pittsburgh architect Andrew Peebles, it was renamed \"Clayton\".  Further remodeling of the house was done in 1892 by Pittsburgh architectFrederick J. Osterling.  The Playhouse was constructed in 1897 to designs by architectsAlden & Harlow. The house served as the Fricks' primary residence from 1883 to 1905.  The Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, where they eventually established theFrick Collection, but in 1981 daughter Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton, where she had previously spent part of each year, and remained there permanently until her death in 1984. Clayton opened to the public in 1990, and in 1997 the 1950s carriage house was enlarged to create the Car and Carriage Museum.[citation needed]",
            "In May 2013 the center announced a $15 million renovation to break ground on June 6, 2013.[1][2]The renovation was completed in 2015; the Car and Carriage Museum was expanded to twice its original size, and a community center and education center were built.[3]"
