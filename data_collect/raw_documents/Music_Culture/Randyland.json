            "Randy Gilson was born inHomestead, Pennsylvania. Early in life he suffered from homelessness and poverty. He moved toPittsburgh's Northsidein 1982, where he was a communityactivist, planting over 800 street gardens and 50 vegetable gardens.[11]Hisguerrilla gardeningplanted vacant lots inManchester, theMexican War Streets, and surrounding neighborhoods.[12]",
            "He bought the property that would become Randyland on a credit card for $10,000 in 1995.[13]Using upcycling, Gilson decorates his home with items such as mannequins, plastic dinosaurs and pink flamingos. The fences display murals with neighbors dancing and smiling.[14]",
            "In late 2016, Gilson's partner David Paul Francis \"Mac\" McDermott was diagnosed with terminalprostate cancer.[15]Upon hearing the news, Randyland fans raised over $20,000 and sent Gilson and McDermott on their first vacation. The couple visited theGrand CanyonandHollywood.[16]Afterwards, Gilson retired from his restaurant job to spend more time with the ailing McDermott. Following the announcement,Foo Connerjoined Randyland as co-director.[11][15][17]",
            "The neighborhood around the museum experienced explosive growth in 2016-2019.[18]Randyland itself reportedly doubled in attendance.[19]The courtyard was overhauled to accommodate the traffic. Under Conner's curation, the facility embraced being aselfie museumas a vibrant backdrop for photos.[20]",
            "McDermott died on January 10, 2019.[19]As Gilson's partner, he was posthumously given the title of co-founder. Journalists noted that McDermott may have downplayed his role when alive but was a backbone of the museum.[21]Later that year, Randyland received the Mayor's Award for Public Art for 2019. Conner left the museum early 2020.[20]",
            "Because it is outdoors, Randyland was one of the only art museums open in Pennsylvania during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[18]Gilson came out of retirement. The Courtyard was changed to a socially distanced playground throughout quarantine. Many of the original murals have been painted over.",
            "As of 2022, Randyland is still a free and popular tourist attraction.[22][23]"
