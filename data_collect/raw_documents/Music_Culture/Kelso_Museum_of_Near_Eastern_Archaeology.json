            "Pittsburgh Theological Seminary was formed in 1959 by consolidating thePresbyterian Church in the U.S.A.'sWestern Theological Seminaryand theUnited Presbyterian Church of North America'sPittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. The consolidation was the result of the 1958 merger between the PCUSA and the UPCNA to form theUnited Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.",
            "Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary began with the founding ofService Seminary(Associate Theological Seminary in the town of Service,Beaver County, Pennsylvania) in 1792 by the Associate Presbytery of Pennsylvania. Prior to that time, the Presbytery was dependent on a supply of ministers sent fromScotland.John Andersonwas elected as the first teacher of divinity and the school began with an enrollment of six students. Service Seminary moved several times, from Service toCanonsburg, Pennsylvania, then toXenia, Ohio, where it becameXenia Theological Seminary. This occurred in the 1850s and was prompted by a desire to locate nearer to the growing population in theMidwest. Joseph Kyle joined the faculty in 1900 (leaving 4th United Presbyterian Church inAllegheny, Pennsylvania). In approximately 1914, Kyle was appointed president. In 1920, the trustees determined to move the seminary toSt. Louis, Missouri, also to be nearer to potential students in thePlainsstates. In 1921, Kyle died unexpectedly. This loss of leadership at a crucial transition period created problems for the fledgling institution and it never really took root. In 1930, Xenia merged with a seminary that was founded in Pittsburgh in 1825, which was known asPittsburgh Seminary(1825–1833; 1913–1930) andAllegheny Seminary(1833–1912).[1]Together Pittsburgh and Xenia formed the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. This institution was later augmented by the resources ofNewburgh Seminary, founded in New York City in 1805 byJohn Mitchell Mason.",
            "Western Theological Seminary, the other branch of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's pre-1959 history, began with the establishment of classical academies inWashington, Pennsylvania, the first in 1785 by Joseph Smith and another in 1787 by John McMillan. Out of these academies, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church USA created Western Seminary. It was indeed a western seminary in 1825, furnishing a ministry for the rapidly opening frontier territories along the Ohio River.[2]",
            "Since the 1959 consolidation, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary has been located on the former Pittsburgh-Xenia Seminary campus in the Highland Park/East Liberty section of Pittsburgh. It became a PC (USA) seminary following the 1983 merger between the UPCUSA and thePresbyterian Church in the United States."

The museum contains a collection of ancient Near Eastern and Palestinian pottery and artifacts brought together by travelers and archeologists over the past 60 years. Many exhibits resulted from the eight excavations of which the seminary has been a part.",
            "The Seminary is very involved inBiblical archaeology, and sponsors the Zeitah Excavations in Israel atTel Zayit.[8]The excavation was founded under the direction of Professor Ron E. Tappy, Professor of Bible and Archaeology and director of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The excavation began in 1999 with a 55-member international team of experts and volunteers. In July 2005 excavators discovered theZayit Stone, which contained an inscription dating to the 10th century BCE (King Solomon's reign). The two-line inscription, on a 33-pound limestone boulder embedded in the stone wall of a building, is the earliest securely-dated example of the complete Hebrew alphabet (an \"abecedary\"). The letters show a transitional script emerging from Phoenician and leading to the Hebrew national script of the 9th century BCE. The first significant inscription from this period in nearly a century, the discovery was reported in theNew York Times."
