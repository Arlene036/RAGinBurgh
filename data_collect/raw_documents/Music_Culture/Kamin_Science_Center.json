It used the $10,000 award to contribute to itsCOVID-19vaccination awareness programs.[8]",

        "content": [
            "Its predecessor was theBuhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science, which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth majorplanetariumin theUnited States, and was popular for several decades.  However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, theCarnegie Institute(under the leadership ofRobert Wilburn) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architectTasso Katselas, which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger.[10]The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991.[11]On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center[12]"

            "Until it closed, the firstrobotencounter in Roboworld wasAndy Roid, the Robothespian, aninteractive,animatronicrobot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them.",
