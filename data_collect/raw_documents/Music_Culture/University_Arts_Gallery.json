            "The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the site of the formerSchenley Park Casino, Pittsburgh's first multi-purpose arena with an indoor ice skating rink, sat on the location of the building before burning down in December 1896.[4]",
            "The building itself is a gift ofHelen Clay Frick(1888–1984), daughter of the Pittsburgh industrialist and art patronHenry Clay Frick(1849–1919). She established theFine ArtsDepartment at the University of Pittsburgh in 1926 and continued to fund it through the 1950s, when she first made a commitment to create a separate structure to house it.[5]Land for the project was donated to the university by the City of Pittsburgh.",
            "In early negotiations with the University of Pittsburgh, Miss Frick asked that successors to theNew YorkarchitectsCarrère and Hastingsdesign the new facility after the Italianpalazzoits firm had built inManhattanfor her father some fifty years earlier. Eventually, however, both parties agreed to Burton Kenneth Johnstone Associates as the architects. Its design is modeled afterPope Julius III's (1487–1555)Villa GiuliainRome, Italy. The building is constructed of white limestone and marble with a terracotta tile roof around a central courtyard. An octagonal cupola, which caps the central rotunda, rises 45 feet above the ground.[5]The building houses the University of Pittsburgh's Department of History of Art and Architecture and Department of Studio Arts, and contains classrooms, an open cloister, an art gallery, a 200-seat auditorium, as well as a research library. Construction began in 1962 and the building was opened in May 1965.",
            "By the late 1960s Miss Frick, unhappy that the university did not conform to her restrictions on management of both the department and the new building, severed her ties with the University of Pittsburgh. She responded by creating a new venture,The Frick Art Museum, on the property of her ancestral home, Clayton, a few miles east in Pittsburgh'sPoint Breezeneighborhood. That museum operates today as a part of theFrick Art & Historical Centercomplex."

            "Today, the Frick Fine Arts Building consists of classrooms, art studios, a library, and art galleries around an open cloister and contains a 45 feet (14 m) high octagon capped by a pyramidal roof.[6]",
            "A noted 1965 low relief portrait of Henry Clay Frick byMalvina Hoffmanin limestone sits above the entrance to the building. Hoffman was 79 years old when she accepted the commission. She could not sculpt it herself because union rules prevented sculptors from working on a relief attached to a building. However, she climbed up on the scaffolding to oversee the completion of the work.[7][8]Inside the main entrance, a neon work by contemporary Chinese artistGu Wendais installed in the lobby.[9]",
            "The building also contains a 200-seat auditorium that is used for lectures, performances, and special events.[10]"

            "The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister is a main feature of the Frick Fine Arts Building. Its large paintings ofItalianmasterpieces are scale reproductions that were commissioned in 1911 fromNicholas Lochoffby the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts (now thePushkin Museum of Fine Arts). Lochoff worked slowly and carefully. Only a few paintings were completed and sent back toRussiaby theRussian Revolution of 1917. Lochoff, unable to return because of new communist regime, felt compelled to sell off the paintings. Buyers includedHarvard Universityand the Frick Art Reference Library in New York. Miss Frick acquired the entire collection, however, after Lochoff's death, with the help of art criticBernard Berenson. In 2003, the paintings were cleaned and restored by Christine Daulton. Also in the gallery are notedCarraramarble reproductions of 14th centuryAnnunciationfigures by sculptorAlceo Dossena.[11]"
