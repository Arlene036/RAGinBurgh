            "The main structure of Salk Hall is the former city ownedPittsburghMunicipal Hospital for Contagious Diseases constructed in 1941 on land the university had given to the city.  It was designed by Richard Irving and Theodore Eicholz.[5]The hospital was built as a project by President Roosevelt'sPublic Works Administration.[6]The 225-bed hospital was originally part of the Medical Center associated with the University and was intended to be used primarily to treat communicable diseases. However, when antibiotics virtually eliminated the need to quarantine patients, the building had become a financial burden on the city.  Therefore, in September 1949, work began on remodeling the building, and it temporarily housed Pitt'sSchool of Public Health.[7]In October 1957, the Municipal Hospital was formally acquired from the city for $1.3 million ($14.1 million today) and renamed Jonas Salk Hall.  For a time, the upper floors of the building served as a residence for students.  Pitt remodeled it to house theSchool of Dental MedicineandSchool of Pharmacyin 1961-1962.[8]"
