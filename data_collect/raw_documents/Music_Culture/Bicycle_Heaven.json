                "Benjamin Bowden, a Britishindustrial designer, designed a space-age fiberglass bicycle in 1946. Bowden named the design the Spacelander; it entered production in 1960 and sold for $89.50.[9]Only 522 Spacelander bicycles were made in the original run.[10]By the 1990s only a few dozen were estimated to have survived. Morrow collected 17 of the proposed 38 left in the world.[11]The Bowden Spacelanders are some rarest bicycles in the museum. Given their scarcity and good condition, they are valued over $50,000 each.[12][13]"
