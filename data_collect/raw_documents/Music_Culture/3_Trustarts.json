A season ticket package —also known as a subscription—allows you to purchase the same number of tickets for every show in your selected series all at once. All of your performances will fall on a set day of the week and time; you may also have the same seat assignment for each show. For example: If you are assigned seats in First Tier Left Center B 101-102 for the Tuesday Evening subscription of the PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh series, you will attend seven predetermined Broadway shows that are scheduled on Tuesday evening at 7:30PM and you will sit in these seat locations every time. We have many subscription series available: PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Dance Council, Trust Cabaret Series, Liberty Magic, Children’s Theater Series, and Bridge Theater Series.",

Many shows offer a special price on tickets and by choosing to be an early buyer, you are locking in the best prices we are able to offer for these shows. Buying the shows in one convenient package also means that you don’t have to remember to order your tickets as each show goes on sale. Other perks include ticket exchange privileges, swap-a-show opportunity, the ability to purchase additional tickets to some shows in your series before the general public, payment plans, convenient prepaid guaranteed parking and dining discounts to complete your experience at the theater.",

With these prepaid parking passes you are guaranteed entry into Theater Square Garage, ensuring you a hassle-free start to your outing. Each parking pass is good for one vehicle to gain entry to the garage during event hours – weekday evenings after 4:00PM and all day on Saturday and Sunday. Please remember to safeguard your parking passes as we cannot replace them if lost, stolen, or destroyed.",
