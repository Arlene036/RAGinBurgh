            "Fort Pittwas afortin what is now the city ofPittsburgh,Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The fort was built in 1758 during theFrench and Indian War, next to the site ofFort Duquesne. The French built Fort Duquesne at the beginning of that war, and it became a focal point due to its strategic river location. TheBraddock expedition, a 1755 attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with a bloody repulse at theMonongahela River. The French garrisonviciously mauledan attacking British regiment in September 1758, but abandoned and destroyed the fort at the approach of GeneralJohn Forbes's expedition in November.",
            "TheForbes expeditionwas successful where the Braddock expedition had failed because of theTreaty of Easton, in which areaAmerican Indiansagreed to abandon their alliance with the French. American Indians— primarilyDelawaresandShawnees— made this agreement with the understanding that the British military would leave the area after the war. The Indians wanted a trading post on the spot, but they did not want a British army garrison. The British, however, built a new fort on the site and named it Fort Pitt, afterWilliam Pitt the Elder.",
            "As a result, in 1763 local Delawares and Shawnees took part inPontiac's Rebellion, an effort to drive the British out of their territory. The Indians'siege of Fort Pittbegan on June 22, 1763, but the fort was too strong to be taken by force. In negotiations during the siege, the commander of Fort Pitt gave two Delaware emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox, in hopes of infecting the surrounding Indians and ending the siege. The effectiveness of this attempt is unclear. Outbreaks of smallpox had plagued Native Americans for years before, during and after the Fort Pitt attempt, killing much of the Native American population. On August 1, 1763, most of the Indians broke off the siege in order to intercept an approaching force under ColonelHenry Bouquet, resulting in theBattle of Bushy Run. Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 10.",
            "After Pontiac's War, Fort Pitt was no longer necessary to the British Crown and was abandoned to the locals in 1772. At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a power struggle for the region commenced. Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, and for a brief while in the 1770s it was called Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia's GovernorLord Dunmore. The fort served as a staging ground inDunmore's Warof 1774.",
            "During theAmerican Revolutionary War, Fort Pitt served as a headquarters for thewestern theatreof the war. Fort Pitt fell into disrepair once again in the years following the Revolution. It was abandoned in 1792 whenFort Fayettewas built to replace it. Residents of the growing Pittsburgh used the remnants of the fort to build permanent housing for themselves.",
            "A small brick building called theBlockhouse—actually a type of outbuilding known as aredoubt—remains inPoint State Park, the only intact remnant of Fort Pitt. It was erected in 1764 and is believed to be the oldest building, not only in Pittsburgh but in western Pennsylvania. Used for many years as a home, the blockhouse was purchased and has been preserved for many years by theDaughters of the American Revolution, who make it open to the public. Part of the foundations of Fort Pitt have been excavated and some of the fort has been rebuilt, though, giving visitors to Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section the Monongahela Bastion houses the Fort Pitt Museum.",

            "Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of thePennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th-anniversary celebration in 2008.",
            "Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. Thehomelesshave used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years.Graffition the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart. The goal of the restoration project is to re-establish the park as a recreational destination.",
            "Plans for improving the park are well underway.  They include installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the restrooms, renovating thewater taxilandings and surrounding docks, and installing wirelessinternetaccess hubs.  Currently (April 2011) the waterfront area is closed to pedestrians as the stone walkways and wharf area are being resurfaced.  They are to be reopened during the summer, 2011.[2]",
            "These plans were not put into place without some controversy. On January 25, 2007, thirteen members of two different localslabour unionswere arrested for blocking access by contractors to the work sites at the remnants of Fort Pitt. The labour union protested the use of four non-labour workers by the contractor responsible for completing the work at Point State Park.[1]",
            "On August 14, 2009, the state closed the museum and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis. Management of the museum is supposed to be taken over by Senator John Heinz Regional History Center once the state budget is passed.[3]The Senator John Heinz History Center reopened the Fort Pitt Museum on Saturday, April 17, 2010. The History Center's museum system also includes a Smithsonian-affiliated, seven-story museum in Pittsburgh's Strip District;  Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America located in Avella, Pa.; and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, a two-floor museum-within-a-museum at the History Center.[4]",
            "Currently, the Fort Pitt Museum is open to visitation seven days a week from 10am - 5pm.  The museum is closed only on major holidays (Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving and Easter)[5]"
