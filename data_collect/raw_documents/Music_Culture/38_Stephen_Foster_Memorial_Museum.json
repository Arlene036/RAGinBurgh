These three additions were designed by Pittsburgh architect Michael Chirigos whose work was inspired by the memorial's Gothic arches. The banquette's seats enclose arched cabinets showcasing playbills for future productions along with college and career memorabilia associated withGene Kelly's youngest brother, Fred. Both Kellys were Pitt graduates, and it was Fred who taught Gene and many others to dance. The display's cost was underwritten by Fred Kelly's family as an honor to his achievements as an influential choreographer who later became a pioneering television producer and director. The lobby also commemorates outstanding Pitt Theater alumni who are recipients of Department of Theatre Art's annual Fred Kelly Award.[15]"

                "The main 478-seat traditionalprosceniumtheater, formerly known as the Foster Memorial Theatre,[16]was renamed as the Charity Randall Theatre following a $2 million renovation in 2003. The theater was reconditioned to bring it up to code, update its equipment, and replicate the original conditions of the auditorium's features. These renovations were undertaken with donations from the Charity Randall Foundation which was established in 1977 to remember the sister of Pitt graduate and businessman Robert Randall and to support her interest in the arts after her death in a car accident.[15]The plush, deep red seats, identical to those first installedNew York'sRadio City Music Hall, were reupholstered and their wrought iron frames and oak arms refinished to their original 1930s condition.[12]The number of seats were reduced from 572 to 478, including the addition of 24 new freestanding balcony seats. Other auditorium improvements include new carpeting and new lighting that highlights the vaulted stone ceiling, as well as a restoration of the original Samuel Yellin designed chandelier.[15]In addition, state-of-the-art sound, lighting, and production equipment was added, as well as a new rigging system, actors' restroom, and various stage improvements.[17]"

            "The memorial itself was conceived in 1927 when the Tuesday Musical Club, founded in 1889 by affluent female musicians, and University of Pittsburgh ChancellorJohn Bowmanagreed to collaborate on a performance hall dedicated toStephen Fosterthat would house the club's recitals.[21]Bowman donated land adjacent to where the foundation for the Cathedral of Learning was being laid for the memorial. However, little progress on the memorial was made until 1932 when Bowman learned of Josiah Kirby Lilly's Foster Hall Collection. After Lilly pledged more than 10,000 Foster items, fund-raising began in earnest, with almost half the $550,000 cost coming from Lilly and his son,Eli.[15]Construction began January 13, 1935, the 71st anniversary of Foster's death. A dedication ceremony took place on June 2, 1937, Pitt's 150th anniversary.[11][15]",
            "The Foster Hall Collection itself was established in 1930 byJosiah Kirby Lilly, noted for being the president of the prominentIndianapolispharmaceutical manufacturerEli Lilly and Company. The collection originally began as a retirement hobby based upon his lifelong love of Stephen Foster' s music, but it eventually grew into one of the major collections of American music and history. Lilly and his staff, with the help of some of Foster's relatives, as well as through contributions prompted by the publication of the Foster Hall Bulletin, accumulated over 10,000 Foster items. This initial collection was housed in Indianapolis in a small limestone building he called \"Foster Hall.\" Before his effort began, there had been no exact knowledge concerning the total number of Foster's works, nor any accurate literature published about the composer. Foster Hall's staff identified 201 original works, and Foster Hall became a resource center for John Tasker Howard's biographyStephen Foster: America's Troubadour(1934). Concerned about the future of his collection, Lilly donated the Foster Hall's holdings to the University of Pittsburgh's new Stephen Foster Memorial and the collection was moved to its new home in 1937. Since then, some additional 20,000 items reflecting Foster, composers influenced by him, and music in American life have been added.[22]",
            "The university's Center for American Music also houses theEthelbert NevinCollection, which was previously housed in theTheodore M. Finney Music Libraryuntil 1999. The Nevin Collection was acquired by the University of Pittsburgh between 1933 and 1956. The materials in the collection were either purchased or donated by Mrs. Ethelbert Nevin, other family members, and friends. The collection consists of original manuscripts, letters, mementos, furnishings, printed matter, and special gifts.[9]",
            "Aside from maintaining the collections and museum, The Center for American Music's projects includeVoices Across Time, a curriculum support package that allows teachers to integrate historic American Music into their classrooms. The center also has undertakenResources of American History IIthat will provide global online access to music scores, papers, sound recordings, and other American music-related materials in its archives.[23]"
