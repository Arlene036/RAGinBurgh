            "Theexhibitwas initiated by Charles Bowdish  (1896–1988) ofBrookville, Pennsylvania. Bowdish was a soldier duringWorld War I.  When doctors discovered a congenital heart problem, he was honorably discharged from service and sent home, where he began to build models of structures around Brookville, his hometown.  Every Christmas, in his home on Creek Street (the house has since been demolished), the buildings were assembled in a display, complete with Lionel trains running through it.  On Christmas Eve 1920, Charles hosted his brother's wedding and reception, and entertained the guests by running his train display.  One of the guests,Alfred Truman, asked if he could bring some friends over to see it—word quickly spread, and nearly 600 people showed up.",
            "Because of this, Christmas Eve 1920 is considered to be the birth date of the exhibit.",
            "Bowdish soon began setting up and exhibiting his railroad yearly at Christmas time in his house.  Each year there would be a different theme, such asWhite ChristmasorIndian Summer. Therailroadspanned the entire second floor, and no admission fee was ever charged.  Thousands of people saw it over the years, some coming from other countries. A combination of a flood nearly destroying his stored models, and his insurance company refusing to cover the crowds anymore, forced Charles to begin searching for a new home for his work.  He originally offered it to Brookville, but the town declined.",
            "Eventually he offered it to theBuhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Sciencein Pittsburgh (renamedBuhl Science Centerin the 1970s). The Buhl offered him space, and the exhibit opened there on December 1, 1954, and ran until December 31.  During the 31-day period, figures showed that 23,885 visitors viewed the layout. It was originally 14' X 14', and was calledThe Great Christmastown Railroad. It was renamedThe Miniature Railroad & Villagein 1957. The exhibit was an instant hit, and was and still is one of the majorholidayattractions in Pittsburgh. The MRRV was in the basement, and the queue would at times extend out the front door and around the block, and the wait would be four hours long.",
            "Eventually the dates it was open would be the first weekend of November to the last weekend of February. It was then torn down and stored until the next year because the space had to be used for the annualscience fair.",
            "On January 1, 1987, the Buhl officially became a part of theCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. The Buhl staff had been wanting to expand the science center so they could bring in large travelling exhibits, and create more of their own. Joining the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh allowed them to have the resources to do it. Buhl closed on August 31, 1991, andKamin Science Centeropened on October 5, 1991.",
            "A whole new building allowed themuseumto dedicate a room just to the MRRV. The new and expanded Miniature Railroad & Village opened in the Fall of 1992."

            "The current platform is 83 feet (25 m) long by 30 feet (9.1 m) wide, 60% larger than the original.  Five independent loops featureLioneltrains, and oneBowser trolleytravels through the town; these lines operate continuously.",
            "The new display'sphilosophywas thehistoricandeducationalsignificance ofPittsburghand the surrounding areas; this permitted the display to be considered a large, animated history book.  Scenes on the display depict how people worked, lived, and played during the years 1880–1930.  These years cover part of theAmerican Industrial Revolution, theVictorianandEdwardianeras, theGilded Age(asMark Twaincalled it), World War I, theRoaring 20s, and the beginning of theGreat Depression.  All of the models featured on the display are handcrafted by staff, both paid and volunteers, and replicate real structures from aroundWestern Pennsylvania.  The display boasts the largeststeel millever replicated inO scale: theSharon Steel MillfromFarrell, PA, which was constructed from the mill's actual blueprints.",
            "Expert advisors were contracted to make the new display as lifelike as possible. For example, aHarvardprofessor designed thelighting systemto resemble the movement of theSunand actualdaylight. A sophisticatedcomputersystem controls the layout.Opto 22, a company which suppliesNASAandDisney Worldwith control modules, provided the system.",
            "Every year, two months beforeThanksgiving, the display closes down formaintenance.  During this shutdown period, newmodelsare installed, and sometimes new animations are installed, which were constructed earlier in the year, forexhibitionon the display. Occasionally old models are installed as well. Scenes on the display are updated, and the layout is given a careful and thorough cleaning. The exhibit reopens the day after Thanksgiving."
