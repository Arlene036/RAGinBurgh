            "The Miriellos acquired the victorian property which became Trundle Manor in 2007. Their fascination with Goth, Steampunk and classic horror films, led the couple to amass a private collection of oddities. The couple’s intrigue with the macabre began in their respective childhoods.[7][5]Mr. Arm recalls, \"I’ve been collecting since I was a little kid\".[4]They opened their collection, and house, to the public for tours in 2009. It attracts thousands a year as it has been prominently featured as place of interest in Pittsburgh.[8][9][10]Trundle Manor was featured on “MTV’s Extreme Cribs” in 2011.[2][6][11]Apart from giving tours, Trundle Manor also organizes and takes part in various events. It often hosts taxidermy classes, art, and comedy shows.[5][12]They have taken their collection on the road as a traveling 'creep show'.[1][13]"
