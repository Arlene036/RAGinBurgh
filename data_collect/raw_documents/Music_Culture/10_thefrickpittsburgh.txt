Home	The Frick Pittsburgh Equity Commitment
Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, & Inclusion
The Frick Pittsburgh is committed to better serving our community—visitors, staff, artists, scholars, educational partners, and neighbors. The Frick will be an anti-racist, welcoming multicultural organization, a place where all can have authentic experiences with art, history, and nature.
The Frick will work to create an inclusive, equitable, and enlivened creative space by:
Featuring a diverse representation of art, artifacts, and artists in our galleries with specific focus on those historically marginalized by museums;	Broadening the scope of historical narratives presented by inviting new voices and engaging multiple perspectives;	Interpreting inclusive historical narratives relevant in the context of the Frick legacy, Pittsburgh, and the Industrial Age with critical reflection, honesty, and transparency;	Engaging artists, performers, scholars, and community partners diverse in age, race, ethnicity, ability, gender, and sexuality in educational and public programming that explores an array of cultural experiences and intellectual inquiries;	Addressing the physical, mental, and emotional needs of our audiences, employees, and neighbors;	Ensuring equal opportunity in employment and advancement and equity in compensation and professional development;	Engaging our staff and board in regular anti-racism education and self-reflection;	Advocating for change by addressing the expression of concerns related to discrimination, representation, accessibility, and equity.
View our equity commitments	View our Strategic Plan
The Frick Pittsburgh occupies ancestral lands of the Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Osage, and Shawnee peoples. As a place of history and nature, the Frick recognizes the cultural importance of land and the role of cultural institutions in the formation of collective memory. Displacement and erasure are not just histories for native peoples. Land acknowledgements, like historic sites themselves, are exercises in preservation and reconciliation, engaged with past, present, and future.

Frequently Asked Questions
We’ve received a lot of inquiries about the current business model and future of the Café. We thank you for your continued support and hope to answer some of your questions below.	Why did you change the Café? Wasn’t it already perfect?	The atmosphere is magical, and we are committed to keeping it so. But certain aspects of the Café’s pre-COVID business model didn't serve all of our visitors as well as they should. The adjustments we've made address some specific challenges:	In the past, the Café served a small number of people very well, but the great majority of our visitors not at all. During our busiest months, from April to December, the Café was been fully booked at lunchtime days in advance. We routinely turned away two, three, and even four times as many people as we could seat. Without an opportunity for rest and refreshment, many visitors left the Frick before they could experience all we have to offer.	By expanding our open hours, we hope to increase the number of visitors we can serve. From quick-and-easy delights to special-occasion indulgences, we are aiming to meet the needs of as many of our visitors as possible.

Gilded, Not Golden
SCHEDULE A TOUR
Immerse yourself in 1892, a pivotal year for our nation, Pittsburgh, and the Frick family.	Learn more about the Gilded, Not Golden tour	.
"Our tour guide was excellent! Her knowledge and command of the history was excellent. It was clear that she has a love of her job. That's engaging. We had a youngster (about 10 - 12 years old) in our group. He was very bright and was not shy. Our guide did an excellent job of responding to him while not losing track of her objective. She integrated his quizzical mind into the interaction. It was actually amusing to the entire group. I really appreciate the efforts that the museum put into the development of the new tours." - William S.

Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)
<h3>The Civil War You Never Knew</h3>
Comprised of 15 large scale prints,	Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)	revisits the historical representations found in the two-volume anthology published in 1866, "Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War." Walker overlays enlargements of woodcut plates with her black silkscreen cutout figures in solid black silhouette. In doing so, Walker brings to light experiences of racism that were often omitted or merely hinted at in traditional historical narratives.
Kara Walker,	Alabama Loyalists Greeting the Federal Gun-Boats	. From	Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)	, 2005. Offset lithography and silkscreen. Sheet: 39 x 53 inches (99.1 x 134.6 cm). Edition of 35. © Kara Walker
<p><img alt="" src="/Files/Admin/logo.png?d=202494161418" /></p>
The touring presentation of	Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)	is organized by The Museum Box. The exhibition was curated by Lisa Hayes Williams, associate curator at the New Britain Museum of American Art where the show debuted in 2020.

Legacy Planning
The Frick Pittsburgh is an exceptional example of a planned gift at its most generous—Helen Clay Frick left provisions in her will for Clayton, her childhood family home, to be restored and opened to the public along with The Frick Art Museum and the family’s car and carriage collection. That foresight has enabled The Frick Pittsburgh to evolve into the unique museum we have today.	You, too, can create a legacy that will help ensure that the Frick continues to serve students and families well into the future. In addition to making a difference in the lives of others, a planned gift can provide tax savings or income benefits for you and your family. There are many ways to make such a gift—simple methods include gifts in your will or living trust, gifts of life insurance, gifts of retirement assets, and more.	To make the process of legacy giving easy, The Frick has partnered with FreeWill for our community to create an estate plan for free.	FreeWill’s secure online tool empowers you to write a legally valid will or trust in about 20 minutes.	As you write your will, FreeWill presents you with the opportunity to make a planned gift to The Frick on your terms.	If you have ‘non-probate’ assets like a life insurance policy that you’d like to donate, you can	use this FreeWill tool to log all of these assets and name The Frick as a beneficiary.	If you have already created a legacy by including a gift in your estate plan,	will you please complete this form to let us know?	This helps us update our records and thank you for building a legacy to support The Frick’s authentic experiences with art, history, and nature.

Dr. Soumyo Moitra's Story
Dr. Moitra understands the impact that art, history, and nature can have on someone. As a graduate student, Moitra appreciated the ability to come and visit the The Frick Art Museum for free when he didn’t have many resources. “I think it’s so important to have this opportunity, especially if you’re interested in art but can’t afford to pay the price of admission,” Moitra says.	As an adult, Moitra retained his love of art and was compelled to join the Frick as a member, remembering the effect the museums had on him in his younger years. Thinking about his own legacy, he also decided to make a planned gift to the Frick, knowing that his gift would make it possible for future generations of students to visit, as he had.	The Frick has been a key part of Dr. Moitra’s life for many years, and he feels it is important to give back, support the future of the institution, and ensure that anyone can find sanctuary on our campus. We are so thankful for members like Dr. Moitra, who have a positive impact on everything we do here.

Gifts of Stock
Using appreciated stock is an excellent way to make a gift to the Frick because it offers significant tax benefits without affecting your cash flow.
Gifts of stock or appreciated assets	Many donors choose to make gifts of appreciated stocks or mutual funds to offset an anticipated capital gains tax. Even better, you can take a sizeable charitable deduction on your taxes—a deduction that can be used to offset other taxes. Stock or other appreciated assets can also be used to fund a charitable trust or life income agreement.	Transfer of Stock	Before transferring stock to the Frick, please notify us of your intentions and the details of your gift, including stock type and number of shares to be transferred.  We will need this information to properly credit you and issue a receipt for tax purposes.  Below is the information to provide to your broker for an electronic transfer of your gift:

Home	Qualified Charitable Distributions
Qualified Charitable Distributions
Qualified charitable distributions from your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) are current gifts with an immediate impact. Often referred to as "IRA Charitable Rollover Gifts," these gifts are distributions paid directly from an IRA to a nonprofit.	If you are 70½ or older, you can transfer as much as $100,000 per year from an IRA directly to the Frick—without counting this transfer as taxable income.	If you were 70½ before January 1, 2020, the qualified charitable distribution counts toward your required minimum distribution (RMD). If you are 70½ after January 1, 2020, you do not have required minimum distribution until age 72. If you do not meet your RMDs, IRA owners face a large tax penalty. This means you would either withdraw those amounts (increasing your taxable income) or donate them as a qualified charitable distribution.	The most common way to make this gift is to submit a request to your IRA custodian. For more information on Qualified Charitable Distributions to the Frick, contact: Advancement & Engagement staff at 412-342-4086 or	Membership@TheFrickPittsburgh.org	.

Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program (EITC)
The Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program is a Pennsylvania tax credit for businesses who make a donation to an approved nonprofit organization.  The Frick Art Pittsburgh, a valuable source of innovative learning and inspiration, is an approved Educational Improvement Organization.	Companies making a contribution to the Frick through EITC can receive significant tax benefits.  Approved corporations can receive tax credits equal to 75 percent of its contribution up to a maximum of $750,000 per taxable year.  Businesses who agree to provide the same amount for two consecutive tax years can receive 90% of the contribution as a tax credit.  This can mean you receive up to 90% of your gift total as a tax credit: your $10,000 gift could result in a credit as high as $9,000.	Contact Manager of Insitutional Support Jodi Golomb for details at 412-342-4089 or	JGolomb@TheFrickPittsburgh.org	.

2020-2021 Annual Report & Strategic Plan Update
Looking back on the momentous fiscal year that began on April 1, 2020—marked by the global pandemic of Covid-19, the national reckoning with racial justice, the launch of our new Strategic Plan, the 30th anniversary of Clayton’s restoration and public opening, and the 50th anniversary of The Frick Art Museum’s founding—we have much to be thankful for. Our staff, members, and visitors found new ways to engage with our collections and eachother; individuals and funders in our community stepped forward with support when we needed it most; and the Frick has emerged from this year a more flexible, humble, and socially committed organization.

Home	Land Acknowledgement
Land Acknowledgement	The Frick Pittsburgh occupies ancestral lands of the Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Osage, and Shawnee peoples. As a place of history and nature, the Frick recognizes the cultural importance of land and the role of cultural institutions in the formation of collective memory. Displacement and erasure are not just histories for native peoples. Land acknowledgements, like historic sites themselves, are exercises in preservation and reconciliation, engaged with past, present, and future.

Home	Family and Legacy
The Frick Family	The Frick Pittsburgh is the legacy of Helen Clay Frick, daughter of industrialist Henry Clay Frick and his wife Adelaide Howard Childs Frick. The family lived at Clayton from 1883 to 1905.
accordion
Helen Clay Frick
(1888-1984)	The Frick Pittsburgh is Helen Clay Frick’s legacy to her hometown. As benefactress, she gave us all a place to experience art, history and nature. It was her vision that the Frick would be a place that encourages and develops the study of fine arts, and of advancing the knowledge of kindred subjects through the exploration of social history of the nineteenth century and choice exhibitions of fine and decorative art.	Helen grew up at Clayton as the third child of Henry Clay Frick and his wife, Adelaide Howard Childs. She retained a fondness for her childhood home throughout her life. The family’s move to New York City in 1905 was not an entirely happy change for Helen. She loved Pittsburgh and considered it to be her home. In fact, much of her personal philanthropy was focused on southwestern Pennsylvania. This included the establishment of the Westmoreland-Fayette Historical Society, to preserve the West Overton homestead where her father was born; the founding of the Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts Department at the University of Pittsburgh; the construction of The Frick Art Museum; and the restoration of Clayton.	She was strongly influenced by her father’s interest in art collecting, and, from an early age, she took an active interest in his collection. As a young woman Helen Clay Frick began assembling her own art collection, increasing her acquisitions in the 1960s in preparation for the opening of The Frick Art Museum in 1970.	Perhaps her greatest achievement, was the development of the Frick Art Reference Library in New York, which she began in the 1920s as a research library and photo archive dedicated to the study of western art. Helen Clay Frick oversaw the operations of the library until the year before her death, and it continues to be one of the top research institutions in the country.	Although Helen Clay Frick never married, she delighted in the company of her nieces and nephews and often hosted family and friends at her farm in Bedford, New York, as well as at her homes Eagle Rock at Prides Crossing, Massachusetts, and Clayton.
Henry Clay Frick
(1849-1919)	Henry Clay Frick’s story began in West Overton, Pennsylvania, a rural village settled by Mennonites 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. His grandfather, Abraham Overholt, owned the Overholt Distillery and was a leading figure in the village. Henry’s rise to prominence and prosperity began close to home, when as a young man, he realized the potential of local bituminous coal. At the age of 21, he borrowed money and formed a partnership, Frick & Co, with two cousins and a friend. The newly formed business used beehive ovens to turn coal into coke, a fuel in great demand by the growing steel industry in Pittsburgh.	Frick prospered at a time when heavy industries and private fortunes were growing to unprecedented sizes. By the late 1870s, Frick bought out his partners. The company, now known as H.C. Frick and Company, had nearly 1,000 employees, and Frick was a millionaire by the time he was 30. Eleven years later he met  Adelaide Howard Childs (1859-1931), and they were married December 15, 1881.	While staying in New York City on their wedding trip, the Fricks were guests at a luncheon hosted by Andrew Carnegie. It was then that the partnership between H.C. Frick and Company and Carnegie Steel was officially announced. The union of the two men cemented their dominance over the Pittsburgh steel industry, and led to the eventual formation of United States Steel.	In 1892, a labor dispute between Homestead Steel—the nation’s largest producer of steel, owned by Frick and Carnegie—and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers—its largest craft union—escalated into a major, violent event.	That summer, with Carnegie out of the country and the dispute still unresolved, Frick closed the mill, locking out 3,800 workers and intending to replace them with non-union employees. The union workers then seized the mill. Frick, in return, arranged for 300 armed Pinkerton detectives to travel by boat down the Ohio River, enter the mill on the river side and reclaim the building.	Almost as soon as the detectives arrived, fighting began between both sides, resulting in loss of life for both steelworkers and Pinkerton detectives. It lasted for 12 hours, and eventually the Pennsylvania National Guard was ordered by the governor to intercede. The mill was secured and Homestead was placed under martial law.	Henry Clay Frick showed an early interest in collecting paintings and drawings. In 1871, he applied for a loan of $10,000 from the bank of T. Mellon & Sons. The agent from the bank who was sent to investigate Frick’s reliability commented that Frick “may be a little too enthusiastic about pictures, but not enough to hurt.”	By 1881 Frick had the resources to begin forming an art collection. His first recorded purchase of a painting was in February of that year. Frick chose a wooded landscape by local artist George Hetzel, who was a member of the Scalp Level School—a group of regional painters who traveled to the countryside to sketch and paint in the manner of the French Barbizon School. Not long after that, Frick purchased other works, including At the Louvre (Une Révélation) by Spanish artist Luis Jiménez y Aranda, a humorous, anecdotal painting of a young woman and her chaperone confronting a classical statue in the Louvre.	Around 1885, after the Frick family was well-settled in Clayton, Frick began collecting in earnest. Much of this early purchasing focuses on French landscape painters of the Barbizon School, including Dessous de Bois (The Forest Floor) by Théodore Rousseau, which hangs in the parlor in Clayton.	The art collection at Clayton generally reflects taste typical of the industrialist-collectors of Gilded Age America, with most works by European artists of the nineteenth century, contemporary to Frick, or from an older generation. His first Old Master purchase has been identified as Still Life with Fruit by Dutch eighteenth-century artist Jan van Os, which now hangs in The Frick Art Museum, alongside other eighteenth-century works collected by both Frick and his daughter, Helen Clay Frick.	Helen took her father’s stated mission of “encouraging and developing the study of the fine arts and of advancing the general knowledge of kindred subjects” to heart, and her own purchases form the core of the collection displayed at The Frick Art Museum, which has particularly outstanding examples of early Renaissance Sienese painting and eighteenth-century French painting, furniture and decorative arts.
Childs Frick
(1883-1965)	The eldest of the Frick family’s four children, the family moved into their Point Breeze home (later called Clayton) shortly before his birth in March 1883. Childs demonstrated an early interest in natural science—identifying, catching, and tagging animals such as rabbits and raccoons, examining rocks with his geology kit, and studying taxidermy. He also experimented with photography.	After attending Princeton University, Childs began the first of many expeditions to Africa and the American West to collect animal specimens and fossils for study, many of which were donated to the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh.	In 1913 Childs married Frances Dixon and they eventually settled in Roslyn, Long Island. As a gift for his son and daughter-in-law, Henry Clay Frick purchased the former estate of William Cullen Bryant and renovated a Georgian mansion on the property for the young couple. Childs and Frances renamed the house Clayton and made it their home for almost 50 years. They raised four children–Adelaide, Frances, Martha, and Clay. The home is now the Nassau County Museum of Art.	After the family’s interests and investments transferred to New York, much of Childs’ research and collecting efforts were done in conjunction with the American Museum of Natural History, where he established the Frick Laboratory of Vertebrate Paleontology. He also was named honorary curator of Late Tertiary and Quaternary Mammals, and served as a trustee from 1921 until his death. During that time, he also served as president of the board of trustees of The Frick Collection, New York.
Adelaide Howard Childs Frick
(1859-1931)	Adelaide Howard Childs was born in Pittsburgh on December 16, 1859, to Asa P. Childs and his second wife Martha Howard Childs. (She had five siblings from her father’s first marriage.) The Childs family was well established in Pittsburgh as manufacturers and importers of boots and shoes. Adelaide Childs met Henry Clay Frick in the spring of 1881, and they were married December 15 of that year. After her husband’s death in 1919, Adelaide divided her time between their New York home (now The Frick Collection), their summer home Eagle Rock, and their Pittsburgh home, Clayton. Upon her death, October 4, 1931, her daughter Helen inherited the Pittsburgh home and the summer home and its contents.

Clayton
A triumph of restoration
The home of the Henry Clay Frick family from 1882–1905, this meticulously restored 22-room mansion features an impressive array of fine and decorative art objects purchased by the Fricks. Docent-led tours of the home provide an inside view of daily life at the turn of the 20th century and a better understanding of Pittsburgh during the Gilded Age.	“Clayton is a triumph of restoration,” wrote Susan Mary Alsop in Architectural Digest. It is also a triumph of preservation.	When the Frick family moved to New York in 1905, after living at Clayton for 22 years, they left much of their Pittsburgh life behind. An astonishing 93% of the artifacts in the house are original, making Clayton a home more than a house, and an eloquent evocation of the lives of the family who lived there. Clayton has welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors since it was opened to the public in 1990 after a four-year restoration.	Henry Clay Frick and his wife, Adelaide Howard Childs, purchased Clayton in August 1882 for $25,000. At the time, the house was considerably smaller, an 11-room, Italianate-style building on a 1.43-acre parcel of land. The home, which fronted Penn Avenue in the residential neighborhood of Point Breeze, was located just a half-hour by train from Mr. Frick’s downtown office. The couple moved into Clayton early in 1883, and soon had the first of their four children.	Clayton is unmistakably a family home. A high chair sits in the breakfast room, children’s toys and books are in the nursery and library, and a sink and clothes rack built to a child’s scale are nestled in an alcove outside the kitchen.	By 1891, the family and the Fricks’ social stature both had outgrown the home as it was, and architect Frederick J. Osterling was hired to transform Clayton into the 23-room chateau-style mansion seen today.
Clayton Restoration
The restoration of Clayton began soon after Helen Clay Frick’s death in November 1984. The home’s historic significance was assessed in terms of its importance as an example of domestic architecture of the period, its furnishings, and its status as one of the few intact homes from Pittsburgh’s lost “Millionaire’s Row.” Since the home had been the family’s primary residence from 1883-1905, this time period was selected for the restoration and the basis for historic interpretation. With an established budget of $6 million, the staff began to assemble a team of structural engineers, architects, architectural historians and history and decorative arts experts to undertake the project.	The Office of Thierry W. Despont developed the initial planning document and was the supervising architectural firm. Urban Design Associates of Pittsburgh and Peters Building Co. were the local supervising architects and general contractor, respectively. There were numerous specialty subcontractors, most of whom were local to Pittsburgh, who did the roofing, painting, plastering, and restoration of stone and wood details.	Decorative arts consultants from the Preservation Society of Newport and Winterthur examined the interiors and furnishings of Clayton. Their efforts were supported by documentary photographs and invoices, public documentation, and records from vendors who had worked on Clayton through the years, all of which were used to create an interior furnishing plan.	The physical work was begun in February 1989 and completed in October of the same year.
Greenhouse and Gardens
A Family Estate
The path that winds through the Frick’s 10-acre site is lined with lush gardens and a diverse selection of trees. Our active greenhouse is a renovation and partial reconstruction of one that served the Frick family from 1897 through the 1970s. The original greenhouse, designed by architects Alden & Harlow, was used to grow flowers and tropical plants for Clayton year-round, as well as annuals from seed for outdoor beds, vegetables, and mushrooms.	In the late 19th century, greenhouses and conservatories were common additions to the homes or estates of wealthy families. The Fricks’ greenhouse supplied them with year-round fresh flowers and seedlings for their gardens. The Frick family built their first greenhouse between August 1882 and June 1883.	In 1897, the Fricks replaced their original greenhouse with one built by Alden & Harlow, an architecture firm based in Pittsburgh and Boston, and the firm employed by Andrew Carnegie to design Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Library and Museum complex.	The greenhouse that exists today was rebuilt based on the 1897 Alden & Harlow structure. Through the Frick’s partnership with Grow Pittsburgh, a community group that promotes sustainable agriculture, a wide variety of vegetable and flowers are grown. Many are used to prepare foods in the Café.

The Frick Art Museum
Designed by Pittsburgh architects Pratt, Schafer & Slowik, the Italian Renaissance-style Frick Art Museum houses the collection of Helen Clay Frick, founder of the Frick Art & Historical Center. The museum displays work collected by Miss Frick, which features French 18th-century painting and decorative arts, and early Italian Renaissance painting, as well as special touring exhibitions.	The Frick Art Museum was opened in 1970 to house Helen Clay Frick’s personal collection of fine and decorative arts, which has particularly outstanding examples of early-Renaissance Sienese painting, and 18th-century French painting, furniture, and decorative arts. The Museum was designed to exhibit the collection in an atmosphere of intimacy.	Highlights of the permanent collection include a portrait by Rubens, a pastoral scene by Boucher, and Italian panel paintings by Giovanni di Paolo and Sassetta.	The museum also hosts an ongoing schedule of traveling exhibitions and related lectures, tours	and workshops.
Car and Carriage Museum
After the turn of the 20th century, the development of the automobile profoundly changed American life. In the Car and Carriage Museum, visitors can travel back to the time of carriages, see some of the first horseless carriages to have an impact on Pittsburgh and learn about Pittsburgh’s role in the developing automobile industry.	The Car and Carriage Museum houses the Frick’s collection of historic carriages and automobiles dating back to the turn of the 20th century. Recent expansion and renovation initiatives provide for added space, higher ceilings and better lighting to improve your visitor experience.	Henry Clay Frick’s 1914 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost touring car and Howard Heinz’s 1898 Panhard (reputed to be the first car in Pittsburgh) are both on view, as part of a selection of historic vehicles that illustrate the story of how the automobile transformed early-20th-century life.
Playhouse
Designed by the architectural firm Alden & Harlow in 1897, the Playhouse was a center of activity for the Frick children when the Fricks lived at Clayton. Family photographs show many children gathered here for parties and events. Original amenities included furniture built to the smaller scale of the rooms, a bowling alley and a darkroom for Childs Frick’s pursuit of photography.	Today, staff offices are housed in the Playhouse, and it is not accessible to visitors.
Education Center	The Education Center is the hub of what the Frick is all about. Three spacious classrooms serve a multitude of program participants, from school groups to seniors. This dedicated learning space at the heart of the Frick campus is equipped with technologies that enhance the Frick’s high-quality, artifact-based programs.
Community Room	The 1,000-square-foot Community Room is the perfect location for your next small event or business meeting. Amenities of the Center, which also encompasses a 600-square-foot terrace, include a high definition projector, A/V technology inputs for presentations and hearing-assisted technology, and a catering prep kitchen allows for food preparation, storage and service.

About Clayton
The home of the Henry Clay Frick family from 1882–1905, this meticulously preserved 23-room mansion reveals the lifestyle of a prominent, wealthy family who lived in Pittsburgh at the height of the city’s cultural and economic importance. Today, Clayton is the last remaining home of its kind in Pittsburgh, standing as a testament to another era and offering unique insights into our city’s past.
The Frick family — Henry Clay Frick, Adelaide Howard Childs Frick, and their children, Childs Frick, Martha Howard Frick, Helen Clay Frick, and Henry Clay Frick, Jr. — lived in Clayton during the Gilded Age, the forty-year period following the end of the American Civil War, a time of rapid, intense change that ushered in the modern era of the United States. Forces such as industrialization, urbanization, technological advances and immigration collided to fundamentally alter the American way of life — creating great wealth and progress, but also social upheaval and startling inequity that continue to impact our world today.

About the Clayton Tour Experience
Guided tours of Clayton immerse visitors in the year 1892, a critical year for our nation, Pittsburgh, and the Frick family. Considered to be the height of the Gilded Age, the early 1890’s brought the era’s extremes into stark relief — both the progress of technological advancements and economic growth, and the harsher realities of issues like wealth disparity, social unrest, and environmental degradation. Nowhere were these extremes more pronounced than in Pittsburgh — America’s industrial powerhouse and one of the era’s most influential cities. Tours of Clayton explore how these extremes affected the lives of everyone who lived in Pittsburgh at the time, though in dramatically different ways.
"It's always a great experience. I've been three times now and each time it gets better. Each guide gives a new light to each room and time period, which is always interesting and so, so welcome."	- Joshua K.
Rather than focus on the design of Clayton and its contents, this tour experience emphasizes the stories of real people — those who lived within Clayton’s walls and those who did not. Visitors to Clayton should expect to participate in a dialogue alongside their guide and other visitors. Conversations will include discussions of a wide variety of historical experiences, not just those of the Frick family, as well as the ongoing legacy of the Gilded Age and its impact on our lives today.
"The tour was not romanticized; it was based on facts and reality. I really loved it. I have never been in a tour where the guide tells us exactly how things were during that time. We were so interested that we continued doing some research at home that evening."	- Yesenia F.
Content advisory: 1892 was a tumultuous year for the Frick family and the Pittsburgh steel industry. For this reason, tours of Clayton deal with potentially challenging subject matter, including discussions of violence, grief and child loss.
While all are welcome on tours of Clayton, the tour is most appropriate for children 9 years and older.

Clayton Reimagined
Clayton opened to the public in 1990 as part of the vision of Helen Clay Frick, who sought to preserve her family home and her father’s legacy for public benefit. When the house opened, visitors experienced the home through a docent-led tour that focused primarily on the experiences of the Fricks as a wealthy, white family living in Pittsburgh during the Gilded Age. In the more than 30 years since, we have welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors to one of the most authentic historic houses in the country.
Today, The Frick Pittsburgh furthers Helen’s vision of sharing authentic experiences with art, history and nature, and more recently, the Frick has adopted a strategic plan that includes a commitment to expanding access and telling inclusive stories. As part of these commitments, in 2021, the Frick Pittsburgh embarked on a grant-funded project to develop a new tour experience in Clayton. The goal was to create a visitor experience that resulted in a fuller, more complex view of late 19th-century Pittsburgh.
One of the most exciting parts of our efforts to reimagine the Clayton tour experience is that we didn’t do it alone. For the first time since the house opened to the public more than 30 years ago, a diverse group of scholars, community stakeholders, researchers, and museum leaders came together to think creatively about Clayton, its stories, and its future. This new tour experience, Gilded, Not Golden, launches in May 2023 thanks to the dedicated work of so many. The Frick Pittsburgh is honored to work with this incredible group of people and grateful for the support and expertise each individual brought to the project.
The Frick Pittsburgh owes additional gratitude to Michelle Moon and Rainey Tisdale, interpretive specialists, for their guidance and expert stewardship of this project.

A triumph of restoration
"Clayton is a triumph of restoration," wrote Susan Mary Alsop in Architectural Digest. It is also a triumph of preservation.

When the Frick family moved to New York in 1905, after living at Clayton for 22 years, they left much of their Pittsburgh life behind. An astonishing 93% of the artifacts in the house are original, making Clayton a home more than a house, and an eloquent evocation of the lives of the family who lived there. Clayton has welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors since it was opened to the public in 1990 after a six-year restoration.	Henry Clay Frick and his wife, Adelaide Howard Childs, purchased Clayton in August 1882 for $25,000. At the time, the house was considerably smaller, an 11-room, Italianate-style building on a 1.43-acre parcel of land.	The home, which fronted Penn Avenue in the residential neighborhood of Point Breeze, was located just a half-hour by train from Mr. Frick’s downtown office.

A high chair sits in the breakfast room, children’s toys and books are in the nursery and library, and a sink and clothes rack built to a child’s scale are nestled in an alcove outside the kitchen.	By 1891, the family and the Fricks’ social stature both had outgrown the home as it was, and architect Frederick J. Osterling was hired to transform Clayton into the 23-room chateau-style mansion seen today.

About the Tour
Just announced!	Gilded, Not Golden	, the newly reinterpreted tour of Clayton, won a	2024 Leadership in History Award	from the	American Association for State and Local History	.
Look beneath the “gilded” surface of the late 19th century to reveal the era's more complicated truths. Discover Pittsburgh’s influence as an industrial powerhouse through a shared dialogue about the ongoing legacies of the Gilded Age.
"The tour guide did an excellent job of explaining the house details, decorative arts, family history & Gilded Age, in general. I particularly liked how history of the working class was woven in as a counterpoint to the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy."	- Claire L.
The Gilded Age was an era not only of immense wealth and progress, but also rapid industrialization, unprecedented immigration, and labor strife. Explore this pivotal time in our nation’s history at Clayton, the only remaining fully preserved Gilded Age mansion in Pittsburgh. Join your guide and other visitors for a conversational experience that shares the stories of the Frick family and other Pittsburghers, and considers how the legacy of the Gilded Age continues to affect us today.

In the Car and Carriage Museum, visitors can travel back to the time of horse-drawn carriages, see some of the first horseless carriages to have an impact on Pittsburgh, and learn about Pittsburgh’s role in the developing automobile industry. The Car and Carriage Museum houses the Frick's collection of historic carriages and automobiles dating back to the turn of the 20th century. The museum also hosts temporary exhibitions.	Enhance your visit with a free guided tour of the Car and Carriage Museum. Tours are held at	1 p.m.	and	3 p.m.	on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

Pittsburgh Builds Bridges
How do you build bridges between people?	This question motivates artist Ebtehal Badawi every day. It led to the creation of Pittsburgh Builds Bridges, an initiative that encourages connection, inclusion, and compassion through community artmaking and conversation.	Ebtehal initially conceived her design as an anti-bullying campaign of posters in local schools after her son endured bullying as a young child. The concept grew, and Ebtehal has since brought together more than 5,000 Pittsburghers — children and adults, students, city officials, actors, artists, poets, dancers, and professional athletes, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pirates, and Penguins — to create murals at 50 locations across the region symbolizing unity and harmony. Ebtehal created this community mural with visitors at The Frick Pittsburgh's Summer Friday event on August 2, 2024.	Art has the power to draw people together, and Ebtehal's murals cultivate a sense of belonging. "I started this initiative to bring people together, to plant seeds of love, acceptance, and compassion."
Meet the Artist	Ebtehal Badawi is a Saudi-born artist, photographer, and writer living in Pittsburgh. She knew she wanted to be an artist in fifth grade. After starting her career in biology and industrial hygiene, she eventually transitioned to art, her first love. She is currently studying art therapy in addition to creating artwork.	An esteemed expressionist artist and dedicated culture explorer, Ebtehal embodies the transformative power of art. Her fervent belief in the power of art to heal and build bridges is a source of inspiration to many. Through Pittsburgh Builds Bridges, she has coordinated public art installations that unite the community and promote love and acceptance, one paint brushstroke at a time.	Ebtehal's Website

Home	Exhibitions	Duquesne SoundWalk at the Frick
Duquesne SoundWalk at the Frick	is a new collaboration with students of Duquesne University’s Mary Pappert School of Music. The sounds of Frick past come to life through soundscapes, adding a new layer of dimensionality to the museum-going experience!	QR code exhibits, or SoundSites, are stationed throughout the Frick campus and allow visitors to interpret environment, culture, and history through sound. Recreations of the soundscapes surrounding Clayton in the 1890s, the home of a turn-of-the-century steelworker, the evolution of automobile horns, and the music enjoyed by the Frick family are just some of the sounds visitors can immerse themselves in throughout the site. Pick up a map in the Grable Visitor Center, or discover the stops as you wander the grounds. Use the camera on your smartphone to scan the codes and enjoy! If you don’t have a smart phone, stop by the Visitor Center to borrow one.	The SoundWalk project was recently awarded the 2023-24 John G. Rangos Sr. Prize, a university-wide prize given to innovative academic initiatives imagined by Duquesne University students and faculty members. SoundWalk led Dr. Nicole Vilkner, assistant professor of musicianship, and her students will continue to develop new SoundWalk projects in the future in new locations.	Explore and Listen

Home	Exhibitions	Permanent Collection
Overview	The Permanent Collection	In the galleries at The Frick Art Museum you will find fabulous examples of early Renaissance Italian painting; rare French and Flemish tapestries; Renaissance and Baroque bronze statuettes; eighteenth-century French painting, furniture and decorative arts; spectacular Chinese porcelains; and masterpieces by artists such as Rubens, Boucher, Gainsborough and Fragonard.
The collection at the Frick includes objects purchased by Henry Clay Frick and his daughter Helen, as well as museum purchases and gifts. The Italian gallery features exceptional examples of early Renaissance painting, including Sienese masters Sassetta and Giovanni de Paolo. Also on view in the Italian gallery are a selection of bronzes from the collection purchased In 1916, by Henry Clay Frick from the estate of financier J. P. Morgan. Over 40 of these bronzes are part of the collection of The Frick Pittsburgh, and others are held by The Frick Collection, New York.	The green gallery, with silk velvet wall coverings and crystal chandeliers, was designed to complement the museum’s collection of French painting, with works by Boucher, Fragonard and Pater installed with fine examples of French furniture of the period.

Other highlights of this room include a major portrait by Peter Paul Rubens, a major Venetian scene by Francesco Guardi, and an oil on copper attributed to Antoine Le Nain.	The museum’s Jacobean room, with English oak paneling,  is typically hung with English artworks of the 18th century—including a rotating selection of mezzotints, a fabulous example of a conversation piece by English artist Arthur Devis, and portraits by English masters like Hogarth, Gainsborough, and Reynolds.	The tapestry collection, which hangs in the museum’s rotunda, features examples of French Loire valley weaving in the mille-fleurs tradition as well as the complex, painterly weavings that made Brussels a famed center of Renaissance tapestry production. Rest on the Flight into Egypt is a particularly fine example of an intact devotional weaving of exceptional quality.	Note: Objects on view change periodically and not all of the collection is on display at any one time.

Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program (EITC)
The Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program is a Pennsylvania tax credit for businesses who make a donation to an approved nonprofit organization.  The Frick Art Pittsburgh, a valuable source of innovative learning and inspiration, is an approved Educational Improvement Organization.	Companies making a contribution to the Frick through EITC can receive significant tax benefits.  Approved corporations can receive tax credits equal to 75 percent of its contribution up to a maximum of $750,000 per taxable year.  Businesses who agree to provide the same amount for two consecutive tax years can receive 90% of the contribution as a tax credit.  This can mean you receive up to 90% of your gift total as a tax credit: your $10,000 gift could result in a credit as high as $9,000.	Contact Manager of Insitutional Support Jodi Golomb for details at 412-342-4089 or	JGolomb@TheFrickPittsburgh.org	.

Location	The Frick Art Museum Auditorium
Cost:	$10 members; $15 non-members; $5 students
Description:
Join Kahren Jones Arbitman, Ph.D., for this one hour lecture exploring depictions of the nativity throughout history.
This lecture is the first in a two-part series.	Click here to find information about the other lecture	.

Nativity scenes depicting the events surrounding Christ’s birth have been envisioned in different ways by artists across the centuries. The results, sometimes profound, sometimes ridiculous, can raise a lot of questions for modern viewers. Why, for example, in Netherlandish paintings do artists place a skinny Christ-child on the ground with only a few bits of straw for comfort? Why is the nativity sometimes shown in a stable and other times in a cave? And why is Joseph always shown as older and unhappy?
Giovanni Paolo, Italian, circa 1398,	Nativity	, circa 1450, tempera on panel, 17 3/4 x 23 3/4 in. Frick Art & Historical Center.
Join Kahren Jones Arbitman, Ph.D., for this one hour lecture,	the first in a two-part series	, which will answer these questions while exploring some of western art’s greatest masterpieces. Each is a stand-alone lecture – you do not need to hear one to appreciate the other.
Dr. Arbitman received both an MA and Ph.D. in art history from the University of Pittsburgh with a specialization in seventeenth-century Dutch art, more specifically, Rembrandt. After serving as the first curator-in-charge of The Frick Art Museum in 1985, she went on to become the director of the Palmer Museum of Art at Penn State University and the Executive Director of the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens in Florida.

The art of the nativity has evolved over the centuries to include some extraordinary interpretations of Christ’s birth in Bethlehem. This lecture begins with the imagery of the Italian Renaissance, with vast murals and sumptuous altarpieces, which as often as not included recognizable noblemen dressed in the latest fashions. We will move forward in time, examining works by Caravaggio and Rembrandt, through the Rococo era and onward with discussion of William Blake’s astonishing 19th-century interpretation and Salvador Dali’s of over a century later. In between, Gaugin moves his nativity to Tahiti and Norman Rockwell takes his to middle America.

Telling Their Stories, Recognizing Their Impact: Spencer Ford
February 28, 2024
By:
Dalena Collins, Learning and Interpretive Coordinator	Edited by Alonna Carter-Donaldson, former Burke Family Research Fellow and Research Assistant
You’ve probably heard the phrase, “The kitchen is the heart of the home.” For residents of Clayton, both the Fricks and the staff living there, Spencer Ford, their chef, was the person shaping that “heart.” Spencer Ford was the Frick family chef for at least 16 years.
Spencer was born in Virginia on October 15, 1864. Though the existing payroll records for Clayton only start in 1892, we know that Spencer was living in Pittsburgh as early as 1888, when he married his wife, Hattie. Hattie was also from Virginia, and at the time of their marriage, they were living in Pittsburgh’s 21st Ward.  In 1899 he was shown as living on Aurelia Street in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Spencer never lived in Clayton itself, but it was likely that he lived close to the home since he was there every day, probably early in the morning and late at night. The 21st Ward stretched from the Allegheny River to the Liberty neighborhood which butted up to the property that the Frick’s owned.

Clayton was often a busy home that served multiple purposes. The Fricks were hosting family and friends along with business partners and politicians. As the household chef, Spencer was an integral part of a successful visit to the home. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt visited Clayton for a luncheon. While this luncheon was catered by Hotel Schenley, others like it took place on a regular basis. Events of this size would have been hosted around the holidays or for important business meetings. To create these experiences, Spencer would have worked closely with Adelaide Frick to curate this menu and would have created it with the help of other household staff, like Mary Coyne and Nellie Lupton.
The menu of the luncheon catered by Hotel Schenley for President Theodore Roosevelt's visit. Spencer would have cooked meals similar to this regularly.	Photo courtesy of the Frick Art Reference Library.
While Spencer was used to cooking for large groups and important occasions, daily life at Clayton also asked a lot of the chef. He was expected to prepare six meals per day: three meals for the Frick family and three for the staff living and working in the home. In addition to providing these courses for everyone living in the home, Spencer was also tasked with organizing grocery buying and preparation. During his time working for the family, he developed a relationship with them, especially with Childs Frick, who he exchanged correspondence with when he was away at boarding school in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
For upper class families, dining was an important and well-orchestrated event: “The hour of dinner has been pronounced … to be, in civilized life, the most important hour of the twenty-four.” For fancier meals and events, it was typical to have up to eight distinct courses. Creating and preparing for these occasions was an extensive task for Spencer. Cooking a consommé could take up to five hours depending on the recipe, plus Spencer would have had to pickle any of the food like radishes that would have been eaten between courses. In addition, menus often included several complicated meat dishes that each include sides. Luncheons like this one also included multiple desserts. For example, anytime ice cream was on the menu it was likely made fresh in the kitchen. Hand-churning ice cream for large groups of people would have been extremely time consuming and physically rigorous.  Prep for some of these events would have started days, if not weeks, beforehand, all while preparing the daily meals for staff and family.

Even though Spencer worked for the Fricks for many years, his salary changed very little over that spread of time. In 1892 his wages were $35 (approximately $1,200 today) per month, rising in 1894 to $40 (approximately $1,300 today) per month. This $40 remained consistent for the remainder of the time that he worked for the family until 1909. Comparatively, Ford made more than any of the women who worked in the house but only about half of what the men on the grounds crew, like David Fraser, or the coachman, James Elmore, were making, both of whom were white men. In comparison, when the Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, they paid their new French chef $150 a month. During Spencer’s tenure with the family, payroll records and personal correspondence between Henry Frick’s assistant, F.W. McElroy, and Spencer  indicate that he consistently requested advances on his paychecks, usually for at least half of his pay. These requests became more common in the early 20th century when Spencer had been making the same salary for over a decade.

Spencer did not move with the family to New York in 1905, instead remaining to work in Clayton until late 1909. The Fricks returned to visit Clayton often and the house remained staffed even when the family was not in Pittsburgh, so Spencer would have continued his daily tasks of meal preparation during those years. The 1920 census shows Spencer and his wife Hattie living in Washington, DC, where he continued his work as a chef at a hotel. He passed away shortly after in 1921.

Telling Their Stories, Recognizing Their Impact: Spencer Ford

You’ve probably heard the phrase, “The kitchen is the heart of the home.” For residents of Clayton, both the Fricks and the staff living there, Spencer Ford, their chef, was the person shaping that “heart.” Spencer Ford was the Frick family chef for at least 16 years.
Spencer was born in Virginia on October 15, 1864. Though the existing payroll records for Clayton only start in 1892, we know that Spencer was living in Pittsburgh as early as 1888, when he married his wife, Hattie. Hattie was also from Virginia, and at the time of their marriage, they were living in Pittsburgh’s 21st Ward.  In 1899 he was shown as living on Aurelia Street in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Spencer never lived in Clayton itself, but it was likely that he lived close to the home since he was there every day, probably early in the morning and late at night. The 21st Ward stretched from the Allegheny River to the Liberty neighborhood which butted up to the property that the Frick’s owned.

Clayton was often a busy home that served multiple purposes. The Fricks were hosting family and friends along with business partners and politicians. As the household chef, Spencer was an integral part of a successful visit to the home. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt visited Clayton for a luncheon. While this luncheon was catered by Hotel Schenley, others like it took place on a regular basis. Events of this size would have been hosted around the holidays or for important business meetings. To create these experiences, Spencer would have worked closely with Adelaide Frick to curate this menu and would have created it with the help of other household staff, like Mary Coyne and Nellie Lupton.

While Spencer was used to cooking for large groups and important occasions, daily life at Clayton also asked a lot of the chef. He was expected to prepare six meals per day: three meals for the Frick family and three for the staff living and working in the home. In addition to providing these courses for everyone living in the home, Spencer was also tasked with organizing grocery buying and preparation. During his time working for the family, he developed a relationship with them, especially with Childs Frick, who he exchanged correspondence with when he was away at boarding school in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
For upper class families, dining was an important and well-orchestrated event: “The hour of dinner has been pronounced … to be, in civilized life, the most important hour of the twenty-four.” For fancier meals and events, it was typical to have up to eight distinct courses. Creating and preparing for these occasions was an extensive task for Spencer. Cooking a consommé could take up to five hours depending on the recipe, plus Spencer would have had to pickle any of the food like radishes that would have been eaten between courses. In addition, menus often included several complicated meat dishes that each include sides. Luncheons like this one also included multiple desserts. For example, anytime ice cream was on the menu it was likely made fresh in the kitchen. Hand-churning ice cream for large groups of people would have been extremely time consuming and physically rigorous.  Prep for some of these events would have started days, if not weeks, beforehand, all while preparing the daily meals for staff and family.

Even though Spencer worked for the Fricks for many years, his salary changed very little over that spread of time. In 1892 his wages were $35 (approximately $1,200 today) per month, rising in 1894 to $40 (approximately $1,300 today) per month. This $40 remained consistent for the remainder of the time that he worked for the family until 1909. Comparatively, Ford made more than any of the women who worked in the house but only about half of what the men on the grounds crew, like David Fraser, or the coachman, James Elmore, were making, both of whom were white men. In comparison, when the Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, they paid their new French chef $150 a month. During Spencer’s tenure with the family, payroll records and personal correspondence between Henry Frick’s assistant, F.W. McElroy, and Spencer  indicate that he consistently requested advances on his paychecks, usually for at least half of his pay. These requests became more common in the early 20th century when Spencer had been making the same salary for over a decade.

Spencer did not move with the family to New York in 1905, instead remaining to work in Clayton until late 1909. The Fricks returned to visit Clayton often and the house remained staffed even when the family was not in Pittsburgh, so Spencer would have continued his daily tasks of meal preparation during those years. The 1920 census shows Spencer and his wife Hattie living in Washington, DC, where he continued his work as a chef at a hotel. He passed away shortly after in 1921.

Black History Month: Telling Their Stories, Recognizing Their Impact
The Gilded Age was a time of opulence, expansion, and a period of self-made men and women. For some, it was a glittering dream; one in which those with the know-how and penchant for hard work could climb the proverbial ladder to success. Carnegie, Frick, Gould, Rockefeller, and other industrial-minded men dominated the visage of the period, living lives surrounded by extraordinary wealth and boundless power. The immortality of their legacies is recognized in the names of buildings, libraries, streets, and boroughs.	We know these men.	Yet there were many others left out of stories of the Age: unsung individuals who worked and made a difference through their skills in sometimes quieter ways, still exemplifying the spirit of industry, philanthropy, and service to their communities. These individuals left their marks on the city in indelible ways, from establishing their own businesses when the doors of others were closed to them, participating in charitable activities, running for political office, and taking their earnings back to the African American neighborhoods and organizations, and funding schools and homes for the caretaking of the most vulnerable. There are no buildings or monuments to them. Still, their commitment to improving conditions for thousands of African Americans who came to the City of Pittsburgh in the late 19th through early 20th century lives on in the community building organizers, entrepreneurs, restauranteurs, and educators in the city today.	While there are many stories yet to be told about the Black men and women of Pittsburgh’s Gilded Age, this series will introduce you to three dynamic individuals who shaped the landscape and led lives of service: Jane Grandison, Cumberland Posey, Sr., and Spencer Ford. We invite you to learn about them not just as part of Black history but also as part of the history that makes Pittsburgh great.

The three rivers of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny, the Monongahela, and the Ohio, have always been integral to the city's success. During the Gilded Age, this was particularly true because of the commerce that literally flowed through these bodies of water. While industrialists like Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie utilized these rivers for their steel mills, there was another figure in Pittsburgh who made his living on the water. Cumberland Posey was an African American businessman who found substantial success with his steamboat business and later investments in and around Homestead, PA.

Cumberland Posey was born in 1858 to Mary Elizabeth Fontaine and Alexander Posey, an enslaved family in Maryland. His mother passed away early in his life, and after Emancipation during the Civil War, his father became a minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. The family later moved to Virginia and then to Ohio, where Cumberland started working on boats, a common occupation for African American men who lived in river towns. Some accounts have him working first by sweeping the decks, whereas others report his job as a fireman. At this point, Mr. Posey set his sights on becoming an engineer, a rarity for African American men, who were generally hired for more menial and laborious occupations in the 19th century.  To reach his goal and acquire the knowledge needed to pursue it, he continued to work jobs on various steamboats, slowly gaining the experience and connections he needed. This process was made even more difficult because of the heavy discrimination he encountered.  Yet, his hard work and planning paid off:  he acquired his license as a second engineer in 1877, becoming the first Black man in America to do so. Posey’s reputation followed the flow of the Ohio River, and soon he was known as Captain “Cap” Posey. While traveling along the river, he met his future wife, Anna Stevens, in Athens, Ohio. They were married in 1883 and stayed in Ohio until they ultimately moved to Pennsylvania and settled in Homestead, a city on the rise due to the steel industry.

Soon after getting his engineering license, he started amassing wealth in different industries. He founded the Posey Steamboat Company, which built over 40 steamboats, and the Delta Coal Company. Both of his companies were highly successful. Posey was also one of the founding members of the Posey and Myers coal merchants’ organization. In addition to his companies, he became one of the largest individual property holders in Homestead as part of a real estate venture. However, in 1897, Posey became embroiled in controversy. In June of that year, he and his business partner were arrested for defrauding the Shoenberger Steel Company by selling them a lower-quality coal than they were paying for. The two were released on bail for $3,000 and were eventually found guilty.	Because of Mr. Posey’s success in these industries, he encountered the other industrialists of this time, including Henry Clay Frick. After the Homestead Lockout in 1892, Carnegie and Frick refused to rehire most of the workers who had gone on strike. Posey helped recruit new Black workers and presented the Carnegie businesses as a friendly face to the growing Black community.	One of Cumberland Posey's notable boats, the Cyclone. Photo courtesy of the Cincinnati Public Library's Inland Rivers collection.	Cumberland Posey’s legacy extends far beyond the wealth he built as a businessman. He was also actively involved in many other organizations. He notably became one of the first investors in the Pittsburgh Courier, once the country’s most widely circulated Black newspaper. He was also on the Board of Directors for the Warren ME Church in the Hill District and served as president of the Loendi Club, one of Pittsburgh's oldest literary clubs. At the time of his death in 1925, he was considered “one of the richest men in the city.” He was survived by two sons and one daughter and was buried with full Masonic honors in Homestead Cemetery.	Cumberland Posey's son, Cum Posey, Jr. (pictured front row, second from left), played on and managed the Homestead Grays throughout the early 20th century. Photo courtesy of Historic Pittsburgh.	The Posey family remained influential in Pittsburgh even after Cap’s death – his son Cumberland Posey Jr. was the principal owner of the Homestead Grays, one of the preeminent clubs in the Negro League. He helped to propel the team to a successful and powerful team and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006.	In an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Cumberland Posey’s great-grandson, Evan Posey Baker Jr., said “He was never satisfied with what he accomplished, he wasn’t the type of guy who would sit on his past achievements.”	Bibliography	Belko, Mark. “‘Commodore’ Posey Plied Boats, Ore Trade.” Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, February 21, 1994.	“Business Men Under Arrest.” The Pittsburgh Post, June 6, 1897.	“Capt Cumberland Willis ‘C.

Telling Their Stories, Recognizing Their Impact: Jane Grandison
Content warning
: Jane worked with the Frick family during some of the most difficult times in their lives; this blog post includes discussion of infant mortality and child loss.
A Gilded Age house was only as good as the staff that supported it, and luckily for the Frick household, they had a reliable support system in Jane Grandison, the family nurse and confidante. During the Gilded Age, nursing as a profession was a very intimate career. Nurses like Mrs. Grandison worked closely with a handful of families to help them with long-term childcare on top of any medical expertise they also provided. Because of this it was common for nurses and the families they worked for to develop strong relationships. In the case of the Fricks, Jane was a trusted employee and partner during some of the most difficult periods of their lives.

Much of Jane’s early years are unknown, but she, like many other African Americans, may have migrated to Pittsburgh to seek better opportunities. Born in 1833 in Arkansas, she married Jeremiah “Jerry” Grandison, a native of Washington D.C. The 1880 Pittsburgh census lists Jane Grandison as living in the Hill District neighborhood on Logan Street with Jerry and their two children, Ida and William.
Jane and her family were well-known residents of the Hill District. Her husband Jerry made history in 1878 when Mayor Robert Liddell chose him and two other Black men, Dorsey Jones and Scott Taper, to serve as police officers for the very first time.
Throughout the 1880s, Jane worked as a professional nurse and wealthy families in Pittsburgh, which included the Fricks, frequently employed her. It’s probable that in 1889 she accompanied the Frick family on their vacation in Europe. On this trip, she would have helped to care for the very young Helen Frick. During the summer of 1891, Jane was traveling in Cresson Springs in Cambria County Pennsylvania, to assist the Dalzell family; John Dalzell was a congressman who represented Pittsburgh in the House of Representatives and served for 13 consecutive terms. John and his wife, Mary Duff, had five children and were a well-known family in the city. The Fricks were at the resort as well, attempting to improve the health of their oldest daughter, Martha. A close friend and employee of the Frick’s, Annie Blumenschine Stephany, recalls Jane inquiring about the health of Martha during that same summer. After Martha tragically passed away in August of 1891, Mrs. Grandison was hired by the Fricks once again in 1892.

In addition to caring for Helen, Jane attended to Adelaide Frick either during or directly after the birth of her fourth child, Henry Clay Frick Jr. Henry’s birth was an extremely difficult labor and delivery process for both the mother and child. Jane helped care for Henry Jr. for the entirety of his life, which only lasted for several weeks. After Henry Clay Frick Jr. passed away, the family took post-mortem photographs of the infant, which was common at the time. These photos include Jane Grandison holding the baby on her lap. Her employment by the Frick family during this summer is even more notable because of the tumultuous nature of the time period. During the same summer in 1892, Henry Frick hired 300 Pinkertons, a private police agency, to break a strike in one of his steel mills, resulting in the death of 10 people. Directly afterward, there was an assassination attempt on Henry’s life by Alexander Berkman, an avowed anarchist. Because of the care that she showed his family, Jane was the only person that Henry Frick trusted to cook for him after that incident. Jane’s role at Clayton during and after the summer of 1892 speaks volumes to the intimate relationship between a nurse and her employer, as she was present for an extremely difficult period in the Fricks’ lives—she likely knew them at their most vulnerable.

Jane Grandison’s impact on the city extends far beyond the walls of Clayton and other homes of Pittsburgh’s upper class. One of her greatest legacies was the creation of the Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Women alongside Mary Bond Peck, whose brother David Jones Peck was the first African American to graduate from Rush Medical School in Chicago, IL in 1847. The home, established as a place of refuge for those who needed assistance, opened in 1883, initially in the Hill District. According to the
Pittsburgh Press
, “When the work was started there was no capital other than woman’s indomitable will at the back of the project, and it was by perseverance and patience that success was achieved.” The institution hosted tens of women at a time. One of the first women to stay was “Aunt Peggy,” who was well over 100 years old at the time of her registration at the Home. Mrs. Grandison served as the president of the Home for a time and, during her administration, two new pieces of property were purchased by the institution. She also secured the first state funding for the Home and some of the largest donations in the institution's history. The Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Women moved to the Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar neighborhood and later became known as the Lemington Home. These organizations served the residents of the neighborhood for over 120 years until 2005, when it ultimately closed. In addition to her work with these vital organizations, Jane also served on the Board of Managers of the Lincoln Memorial Cemetery Association and was a member of Trinity AME Church.
At the time of Jane Grandison’s passing in 1896, she was a highly respected resident of the Pittsburgh community. At the end of her life, her estate totaled $1,950 (approximately $70,000 today), which was distributed amongst her children and grandchildren. She is buried in Homewood Cemetery. Her funerary announcement reads:
“Her family lost a loving parent, the community a praiseworthy citizen, the association an earnest, conscientious official, and the board of managers an associate whose demise is deeply deplored and whose absence will be felt in many ways for a long period.”
Today, Jane Grandison is remembered for her life of service, both to the families she worked for and to her community.

Laundry Day	Gilded Age
July 18, 2018
By:	The Frick Pittsburgh
Laundry in the Victorian Era
Keeping clothes clean in the Victorian era was no easy task.
Laundry day for Victorian women (both the lady of the house and the domestic service staff) was called “Blue Monday,” named for the bluing agent used in rinse water
—
but the work took days.  Laundry was so strenuous a job that women were warned in household how-to books about the hazards of straining their backs and muscles while doing laundry. While wealthy families like the Fricks were able to send out their wash or hire a laundress, many were left taking on the difficult chore of laundry themselves.
Wash began on Sunday, when stained clothes were soaked overnight in warm water. In fact, getting water was, in and of itself, a hard task, especially if you didn’t have a pump in your kitchen and were forced to go to the well.  Moreover, once fetched, the water had to be heated manually on the stove in a special wash boiler.
The next morning, on Monday, the clothes would be rubbed, scrubbed, and scoured in a washing tub, and often wrung out by hand.  Homemade soap, made from water, wood ash, and lard, was used to clean the family’s clothes, but there were many different soap recipes for different kinds of fabric. Making the soap was a chore in iteself and the process itself could take up to a week! Many women used a “dolly,” a wooden stick with pins attached to the bottom, that fit into the tub to spin around the load of clothes.  Only the dirtiest clothes, with the worst stains, were scrubbed on a washboard, because scrubbing on metal could damage fabric.
Once the clothes had been washed and wrung damp, they were hung on a clothesline outside to dry.  And the task wasn’t over yet—the next day, starching and ironing had to be done before the clothes could be worn.  Starch was often made at home from wheat, potato gratings, and rice.  Even with starch, almost all clothes had to be ironed, a process that entailed setting “sad” irons (the Victorian meaning of “sad” was “heavy”) on the stove to heat, and then carefully ironing the clothes before the iron cooled too much.  And naturally, tools had to be cleaned and floors had to be mopped after laundry was done.
As time went on, technology improved, as new kinds of irons and various types of mechanical washers were invented (the latter was received with great skepticism). To learn more about domestic life in the Gilded Age, join us this summer for a special Clayton tour,
Duty and Devotion	,
which highlights the women of Clayton, including those working behind-the-scenes.

Curious? Take a peek!
If you've been to the Frick lately, you've seen that we're making improvements to the Car and Carriage Museum. You might have
peeked
through one of the portholes to see cars being moved or interior scaffold being errected.
The Car and Carriage Museum collection is being kept safe and sound while we make important and necessary repairs to the museum roof. These essential repairs will ensure that our permanent collection is preserved for generations to come and will allow us to get the galleries in tip-top shape for
Black Mobility: Autonomy and the Automobile in Pittsburgh 1916–1955
(May 13, 2023–February 4, 2024).
If you are interested in learning more or would like to make a donation to support these improvements or the Black Mobility exhibition, please	email	Maddy Rolla or call her at 412-342-4098.
On September 6, 2022, the Car and Carriage Museum will close for approximately six months.
During that time, the entire collection of cars and carriages will be placed in storage.
Only the Community Room (the function space on the north side of the Car and Carriage Museum building) and accessible restrooms will be open.
The nearby Education Center will remain open as usual.
The closure will accommodate much-needed repairs to the roof and ceiling.
Preventing future water incursion will help to preserve the collection for all.
When the museum reopens in March 2023, it will have a watertight slate roof, additional insulation to enhance the building’s energy efficiency, and a freshly repainted interior.
Watch our website for updates about the next exhibition in the Car and Carriage Museum,	Black Mobility: Autonomy and the Automobile in Pittsburgh 1916–1955	(May 13, 2023–February 4, 2024).
Black Mobility	will not only be the first exhibition in the refurbished galleries, it will also be the first-ever Car and Carriage Museum exhibition to be accompanied by a catalogue.
The Frick has embarked on a series of construction projects, including these important improvements to the Car and Carriage Museum. Together, they will improve accessibility to our site, preserve our collections for future generations, and enhance the beauty and safety of our garden campus. Curious to learn more?	Keep reading

Coaching Four-in-Hand: Sport Driving for the Gilded Age Gentleman	car and carriage museum

Coaching Four-in-Hand: Sport Driving for the Gilded Age Gentleman
In this week’s blog post, Kim Cady, Assistant Curator of the Car and Carriage Museum, tells us about the origins, development, and popularity of coaching as a sport. She researched the topic to develop the museum’s current exhibition	The Hunt for a Seat: Sporting Carriages in the Early Twentieth Century	. If you’re intrigued, stop by the Car and Carriage Museum to see the show, and make sure to also visit	A Sporting Vision: The Paul Mellon Collection of British Sporting Art	at The Frick Art Museum for scenes of coaching adventures in 19th-century England.

Inspired by the English mail runs of the 18th and 19th centuries, wealthy Englishmen and women began to take up coaching as both a social and leisure activity and a competitive sport (Kintrea, 1967). Beginning in 1784, with the London to Bristol route, mail coaches kept strict delivery schedules (Seabrook, 1965, p. 112) so much so that “people set their clocks to the sound of the mail-coach horn” (Kintrea, 1967). As the mail delivery network developed, so did the infrastructure to support long-distance travel, with a proliferation of inns for rests, meals, and changing teams of horses.

As railroads took control of mail delivery in the 1830s (Kintrea, 1967), country gentlemen bought up the out of service coaches to use for pleasure driving. These young men developed four-in-hand teams which raced against each other as well as the old recorded times set by the mail coaches (Kintrea, 1967).  Although these coaches generally had a maximum speed of twelve miles per hour, not being confined to the time schedules imposed by train travel provided a sense of independence for the driver and their passengers as they sat atop the open road coach (Kintrea, 1967).

As coaching gained popularity as a sport, road coaches and drags, carriages similar to the mail coaches, became commonplace on the roadways. A road coach is a style of sporting carriage that is horsed and driven by its owner. Owner/drivers were responsible for the maintenance of his or her coach as well as stabling and caring for their horses. In addition to the ten passengers the coach could hold it also had accommodations at the rear for two footmen—paid staff along on the journey to assist passengers on and off of the coach as well as maintain the team of horses when the whip stepped away from the coach. Adventurous and well-dressed passengers accompanied the whip, or coach driver, on these competitive drives over rudimentary roads in a carriage that offered little comfort.

As the sport of coaching lost its luster in England, it was flourishing among the leisure class in America (Seabrook, 1965, p. 114). The economic boom following the Civil War allowed more free time for newly wealthy industrialists. Men from east-coast cities established coaching clubs after receiving expert training from former mail coach whips in England (Seabrook, 1965, p. 114).	Coaching was not limited, however, to men. Women's clubs allowed female whips to learn the skills necessary for driving a four-in-hand team (Owens, 2018). After mastering their skills these ladies would demonstrate their abilities at their Newport summer estates, where coaching became a prominent feature of the summer social scene (Owens, 2018). In the beginning, the coaching clubs merely drove their teams to races, like those held at Jerome Park (Kintrea, 1967), but soon developed routes comparable to those in England for timed runs (Bell, 2017; Kintrea, 1967).

The Coaching Club of New York, led by Colonel Delancey Kane, created America’s first public run in the	Tally Ho	in 1876 (Bell, 2017). A bright yellow road coach, the Tally Ho traveled from the Brunswick Hotel in New York City to Pelham Manor (Bell, 2017), about a twenty-mile trip. In addition to the	Tally Ho	, the New York Coaching Club also ran the	Pioneer	(Kintrea, 1967). Both coaches have been preserved and can be found at The Long Island Museum and at The Breakers Stables & Carriage House in Newport, respectively.

In addition to these drives, the coaching clubs held annual parades down Fifth Avenue and through Central Park in New York City (Kintrea, 1967; Owens, 2018). These parades served as the closing ceremony of the New York social season (Owens, 2018). The parades were an opportunity for the drivers and passengers to display their coaches, teams, and finery to each other, while also providing a spectacle for onlookers (Owens, 2018). Coaching parades came to an end in 1907, however, as the popularity of the automobile began to increase (Kintrea, 1967).

Seeing the negative effects—congestion and noise—the automobile was having on coaching in America, Alfred Vanderbilt, one of the best-known American whips, became inspired to run his coach	Venture	in England, where he thought the drives would be much more enjoyable. England still offered miles of open road and easily accessible public houses suitable for changing teams and relaxed stops. But the First World War would put an end to the pleasures of coaching in the English countryside for Vanderbilt, who was killed in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915 (Kintrea, 1967).

Driving Herself: Adelaide Howard Childs Frick's Love of Horses	car and carriage museum

Driving Herself: Adelaide Howard Childs Frick's Love of Horses
If you visit the Frick any time this summer, you can immerse yourself in all things horses. Through the paintings in the
A Sporting Vision
exhibition, you can study how galloping horses were depicted before Edward Muybridge’s 1878 motion photography technique captured their moving gait or get lost in the crowd at the side of a busy racetrack. In the Car and Carriage Museum,
The Hunt for a Seat
exhibition brings the carriages and clothing of the
A Sporting Vision
paintings to life, manifesting the world of coaching that was popular in Victorian England and Gilded Age America.
If you visit
The Hunt for a Seat
exhibition in the Car and Carriage Museum, take a few minutes to look at the other carriages in the gallery, those that belonged to and were used by the Frick family between the 1880s and the early 20th century. During this period, you might have seen Mrs. Adelaide Frick at the side of a racetrack, or coaching in Schenley Park.
While all of the family members used horses and carriages in various ways, archival evidence reveals that Adelaide Frick was the most enthusiastic family equestrienne. She enjoyed both riding horses and taking them on carriage drives in the park. Horseback riding even played a role in the Fricks’ courtship, for in 1881 Henry Clay Frick invited young Adelaide Childs for an evening ride.

Horses were also a point of bonding between Mrs. Frick and her son, Childs. The Frick Art Reference Library in New York, where the Frick family papers are held, contains close to one hundred letters between Mrs. Frick and Childs, written while he was away at boarding school in the early 1890s. The topics of these letters were often the same—how the family was doing and how the pets and horses were faring. Childs Frick had a fascination with animals in his childhood and later went on to study paleontology and establish the Frick Laboratory of Vertebrate Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
From the letters, it is apparent that Mrs. Frick was particularly engaged with horses. In one letter she writes to Childs on the condition of a sick horse, “The carriage horse that was sick is getting a long rest and I hope to drive him this week.” In another she mentions an independent carriage ride, “I took a long drive in Schenley Park this a.m. driving my own self.” In still another letter, Mrs. Frick talks later about wanting to attend a horse show but being unable to because of important visitors, “I should like very much to attend the horse show in New York next week but it seems I will not be able to go. Mr. and Mrs. [Andrew] Carnegie are coming to Pittsburgh next week and I will have to be here.”
Is it unusual that Mrs. Frick was an equestrienne? In the nineteenth century, horseback riding and carriage driving were popular hobbies for those who could afford it. It was an elegant hobby that, for the most part, was originally consigned to men. In the late nineteenth century, however, women more and more began to take up the activity, and acceptance of women riding sidesaddle became common. The magazine Rider and Driver, first published in 1891, brazenly claimed, “The girl who can ride horseback is the one who gets the fellows.” The magazine encouraged riding as a form of exercise, contending it was superior to exercising in a gym because it provided an opportunity for fresh air.

This wonderful photo from ca. 1905 shows Mrs. Frick seated sidesaddle on a horse at Eagle Rock, the family’s summer home in Prides Crossing, Massachusetts. To the left stands James Elmore, who began working as coachman for the Fricks in 1895. Elmore was an excellent coachman who cared for the family carriages and horses, managed the carriage house and stables, and oversaw both staff members and supply orders—no easy task for a full stable. When the Fricks left Pittsburgh for New York City in 1905, all of their horses and carriages, along with James Elmore and his wife, moved permanently to Prides Crossing. There, the family continued to enjoy their large collection of carriages in the rural setting, preferring automobiles for city life. Undoubtedly, Mrs. Frick continued her communications about horse and stable management with James Elmore long distance, and looked forward to visits to Eagle Rock, where she could spend time riding and driving the horses she loved.

Launching our new Car and Carriage Museum Tours
car and carriage museum	cars	new tours
May 30, 2019
By:	Amanda Dunyak Gillen, Director of Learning & Visitor Experience
The Learning & Visitor Experience department endeavors to provide high-quality interpretive opportunities for our visitors, whether it be an immersive tour of Clayton, the historic home of the Frick family, or an exploration of the works and themes of the latest exhibition in the art museum. It is both challenging and exciting to develop a new touring opportunity from the beginning, and we have done just this as we launch our new public tours of the Car and Carriage Museum.
Beginning Tuesday, June 4, 2019, the new tours will take place on Tuesdays at 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., and Saturdays and Sundays at 11:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., and last for 45 minutes to an hour. Like the Car and Carriage Museum itself, the tours are free and open to the public. Reservations are not necessary, so just drop by and join us!	The collection in the Car and Carriage Museum is important and interesting, and worth your time to explore. Although labels and text panels in the museum provide rich contextual information, it can be challenging to understand the broader historical significance of a transportation collection. This new tour was created to be a fun, engaging look at the vehicles and the stories they tell both individually and together.  What’s the difference between a formal and informal carriage? Were there really hundreds of automobile manufacturers in the early 20th century? Steam and electric cars were strong rivals of early gas-powered vehicles? And what on earth is livery?	In order to create this new touring opportunity, a new group of interpreters, or docents, was hired and spent several weeks in intensive training with Kim Cady, Assistant Curator, Car and Carriage Museum, and members of the Learning & Visitor Experience staff. They studied each vehicle along with the broader themes of the collection, and worked on engagement and storytelling strategies.

“To the wrongs that need resistance, to the right that needs assistance, to the future in the distance, give yourselves.”	Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947)
Activist Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was an outspoken proponent of and a major influence in the women’s suffrage movement of the early 20th century (PBS, 2019). Catt was born in Ripon, Wisconsin and moved with her family to rural Iowa when she was seven years old (A Biography, 2016). Following her graduation from Iowa Agricultural College, today Iowa State University (Archives of Women, 2019), Catt worked as a Law Clerk, a teacher and later as a school superintendent—a position held by very few women (Archives of Women, 2019).

Catt’s first entry into the suffrage movement was with the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association and soon thereafter as a member of the National American Women’s Suffrage Association (NAWSA) (PBS, 2019). Her excellent organizational skills, fundraising abilities, and motivational speech writing helped her advance quickly to a leadership role within the NAWSA (Carrie Chapman Catt, 2019). By 1900, Catt was handpicked by outgoing President Susan B. Anthony to lead the NAWSA (Editors, 2009). Catt served as NAWSA president from 1900-1904 and again from 1915-1920 leading the organization in a two-prong suffrage campaign approach—seeking both state and federal passage of a voting rights amendment (Carrie Chapman Catt, 2019).

Unlike Alice Paul, leader of the National Women’s Party (NWP), Catt did not agitate for the vote. Catt instead chose to operate strategically in achieving the vote at the state level, compromising where necessary and working within the confines of acceptable female behavior (PBS, 2019). The PBS (2019) article recounts a reporter’s reaction to a 1914 speech given by Catt in New York, “as factual, conciliatory and delivered so as not to offend.” Catt’s leadership and exhaustive campaigning garnered the support of President Woodrow Wilson. In 1918 Wilson backed a federal amendment to the constitution, it was ratified in August 1920 (Britannica, 2019).

Like Paul, Catt’s work in fostering women’s rights did not end with the passage of the 19th amendment. In 1920 Catt restructured the NAWSA—at this time an organization with two million active members—into the League of Women Voters, a bipartisan group whose purpose was to provide direction for women in their new role as electorate while also advancing progressive legislation (Britannica, 2019). The League of Women Voters, a co-ed grassroots organization, continues to serve as a non-partisan, non-sectarian body “encouraging informed and active participation in government…influencing public policy through education and advocacy” (Mission and History, 2019).

Throughout her life, Carrie Chapman Catt believed that women were guaranteed the same inalienable right to participate in the political process as men (Editors, 2009).  She felt that given the opportunity to affect change women would “improve the conditions of life for themselves and their children” (Editors, 2009).

Bon Anniversaire, Tonneau!

Bon Anniversaire, Tonneau!
Celebrating 120 years, our 1898 Panhard et Levassor Tonneau is believed to be one of the earliest automobiles on the roads of Pittsburgh.
By 1898, it was probably one of the most technologically sophisticated vehicles, with such features as aluminum gear-box casing, front-mounted vertical engine, pneumatic tires and wheel steering. This two-cylinder, forty horsepower Panhard was purchased in Paris during the summer of 1900 by Howard C. Heinz, son of Henry J. Heinz. Howard drove the Panhard in the French Century Run, reaching a speed of forty mph (astonishing at the time) before bringing it home to the streets of Pittsburgh (Frick Art & Historical Center, 2015).
Panhard et Levassor, Paris, France. Tonneau, 1898. Frick Art & Historical Center, 1997.7. Gift of G. Whitney Snyder.
Originally founded by Jean-Louis Périn as a woodworking company, René Panhard joined the firm in 1876 as the business changed over to metalworking machine production (Vershinin, 2019). Educated as an engineer and with a background in carriage manufacturing (Vershinin, 2019), it’s not surprising that René transitioned the company once again in 1890 to the manufacturing of automobiles establishing the Panhard et Levassor Company (Les Doyennes De Panhard Levassor, 2017).
Following their successful venture into gas-powered engine production while under license from Daimler, schoolmates René Panhard and Emile Levassor rolled out their first automobile in 1891 (Neidermeyer, 2010). By 1892 this innovative firm had created the mechanical blueprint nearly all other successful manufacturers would follow—front-mounted engine, sliding gear transmission and chain drive design. Called “La Systeme Panhard” it was the beginning of many modernizations the company brought to automotive development, such as wheel steering and standard pneumatic tires (Bomstead, 2006). Panhard et Levassor quickly established a reputation for fine engineering, excellent craftsmanship, superior reliability, and outstanding performance.
With a win in the 1895 Paris-Bordeaux-Paris race, Panhard et Levassor became outstanding players in the early city-to-city races. Although the company suffered a setback in 1897 when Emile Levassor succumbed to injuries suffered in a serious racing accident, the firm continued to develop several important innovations for the Panhard, including a variable-speed carburetor and coil and battery ignition (Bomstead, 2006). These advances aided them the following year when a Panhard secured a first place victory at the Paris-Rouen Trial, the Marseilles-Nice, and the Paris-Amsterdam-Paris races. A triumphant victory in the Paris-Bordeaux event bookended their racing successes in 1898, while winning the Gordon Bennett Circuit des Ardennes race in Belgium and the first Vanderbilt Cup Race on Long Island, New York in 1904, further cemented the marque’s reputation for excellence.

The 1898 Panhard Tonneau on display at the Car and Carriage Museum was found in the 1950s by brothers G. Whitney and William Penn Snyder III when they inquired of the Heinz family if any of their early automobiles were still in existence. The Heinz family, like the Frick’s, kept meticulous records of their purchases and the Snyder’s discovered an 1898 Panhard et Levassor Tonneau that showed no record of having been re-sold by the family. The brother’s, equipped with a list of Heinz property holdings, began their search for the lost Panhard. Their first site was a Heinz owned rooming house in Pittsburgh’s East End. The maintenance man of the building informed the inquisitive brothers that although he did not recall seeing any antique cars on the property, he had come across a false wall in the basement and had always wondered what was behind it. When the three men removed the wall, they unearthed the well preserved 1898 Panhard et Levassor rear-entry Tonneau tucked into the concrete crevice. G. Whitney Snyder restored the vehicle to operable condition and renewed its customized finish of ketchup red body, pickle green spokes, and mustard yellow trim. In April 1979, the Panhard Tonneau was exhibited at the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation’s Old Post Office Museum on the Northside (Davidson, 1984). When the Children’s Museum’s opened in that space in the late 1980s the Panhard, along with other antique automobiles from the Pittsburgh area, found a new home at the Transportation Museum located in Station Square. In 1997, with the expansion of the Car and Carriage Museum, G. Whitney Snyder donated the restored Panhard et Levassor Tonneau to the Frick, followed at Mr. Snyder’s death by fourteen other brass and pre-war vehicles. The Panhards’s bright red body and brass fittings make quite an impact in our recently renovated gallery space.

New Car Smell	cars
February 2, 2018
By:	Sue Morris
New Car Smell
Ever wonder what "new car smell" was like back when cars were, well, actually new to the world?
Only the wealthiest Pittsburghers owned automobiles at first. Although demand expanded and cars were soon made in the Western Pennsylvania region, buying a car at the turn of the last century was complicated. If you wanted the best -- and of course you wanted the best -- you ordered your Mercedes shipped from France, along with a chauffeur/mechanic to drive and maintain it. Elite car owners had staff to care for their cars just as they had coachmen and groomsmen for their horses and carriages. Pittsburghers began acquiring cars by at least 1899, and no doubt competed with one another for the fanciest set of wheels.	Henry Clay Frick wasn't about to be left in anyone's dust. He got a whiff of new car smell on 28 January 1902 when he took delivery of two Mercedes at his Clayton home (now part of The Frick Pittsburgh ). These were described in press reports as 18-24 horsepower and 40-45 horsepower vehicles. Frick reportedly coughed up $15000 (roughly $350000 today) for the cars, plus shipping from France.	They were accompanied by company agent C.L. Charley, who took them out for a test drive around Da Burgh sans Mr. Frick, who thought the January weather rather too nippy for an open-vehicle spin. But by May of that year, the newspapers were reporting about the "go-devil of Mr. Frick...well-recognized around the city and in the parks as a 40-mile flyer" being driven around Schenley Park by his chauffeur Georges Després. And judging from a subsequent Press editorial, Pittsburghers had cause to be alarmed by the proliferation of reckless rich men careening about in their horseless carriages.	Over the next decade, Henry Clay Frick would buy a total of five Mercedes (either entirely new or replacement bodies). The photo below shows one of them, although likely not the one described in the news article from January 1902.

Improving, Preserving, and Enhancing
Current Construction and Restoration at the Frick
The Frick has embarked on a series of construction projects. Together, they will improve accessibility to our site, preserve our collections for future generations, and enhance the beauty and safety of our garden campus. Curious to learn more? Read on to discover what these projects entail, what they mean for your next visit, and how you can become involved.	In the 54 years since The Frick Art Museum first opened its doors, we have welcomed more than 1,000,000 visitors to The Frick Pittsburgh. Our collection of museums, visitor amenities and verdant campus are a treasure of Pittsburgh’s East End. The current projects will enhance it all—from The Frick Art Museum to Clayton, from the Car and Carriage Museum to the Greenhouse and Café.
Why are we undertaking them?	To preserve what you love best about the Frick for the next generation, while providing you with safer, more accessible, and more beautiful means of navigating and enjoying our site today.
What’s happening?
Clayton Preservation Project
In August of 2024, The Frick Pittsburgh embarked upon the next phase of preservation work at Clayton, the historic home of Henry Clay Frick. This project will ensure that Clayton is protected and preserved for decades to come.
Learn More About The Project
How can you become involved?
Visit the Frick and experience for yourself all that we have to offer you—even while these projects are taking place.
Your donation can help support these projects.	Learn more about supporting The Frick Pittsburgh	.
What’s Next?
From 2023 through 2025, we will be turning our attention to Clayton’s magnificent exterior.
In the first year of the project, we expect to remove existing paint and undertake preservation work that arises through that process.	In the second year, we will repaint the 23-room, 4-storey mansion.	In the third year, we will install International Dark-Sky Association-compliant exterior lighting.	The results should showcase Clayton as the regional civic monument it has become!	As part of these activities in the northwest corner of the Frick’s campus, we will enhance the lighting and accessibility of the Penn Avenue pedestrian entrance.

Frequently Asked Questions
accordion
What is happening at Clayton?	We are embarking on a multi-year project to preserve the exterior of the historic home of the Henry Clay Frick family.
Will Clayton remain open during the project?
YES! Clayton will remain open to the public as a museum throughout the preservation project. Guided tours of Clayton are available Tuesdays through Sundays.	Advance reservations are recommended	.
While Clayton will remain open, please note that the exterior appearance will be impacted by scaffolding, fencing, and other contractor activity.
What does the project involve?
Full-scale removal of all exterior paint.	Repair, repointing, and restoration of the exterior brick and masonry.	Application of a Keim mineral silicate coating — a breathable but waterproof, long-lasting historic preservation “paint.”	Repair and restoration of the exterior metal and woodwork.	Repair and restoration of exterior windows, including storm windows.	Repair and restoration of areas of the slate roof and flat roof.
How will you sequence the work?
We are prioritizing major deficiencies over less urgent repairs. Available funding will guide each year’s scope of work.
As we embark on the project, we expect to conduct the project in four phases:
PHASE 1: Northeast section (exterior wall upper levels) and select roof areas	PHASE 2: Upper cornice and select roofs	PHASE 3: Remaining exterior walls, roofs and walking surfaces	PHASE 4: Wood window repair and storm window replacement
How did you prepare for this project?
The Frick engaged preservation architects, Perspectus, to prepare a detailed condition assessment of Clayton. That 240-page report serves as our roadmap for the project. Perspectus, together with their consultants Barber & Hoffman, Inc. and Heritage Conservation Collective, undertook:
field investigation, testing, and analysis;	surveys conducted using a lift and images taken using a drone;	select sampling and material testing of the brick, mortar, and painted finishes;	select testing of paint removal methods; and	select roofing cores at low-slope "flat" roof areas based upon analysis of infrared imagery captured from a drone.
How long will the project take?	Our preliminary timeline is four years, 2024 to 2028. But, as with any old house restoration project, we are prepared for the unexpected, and will adapt the schedule if/as needed.
What comes next?
Following the preservation of Clayton’s exterior, we hope to make further exterior and interior improvements, including:
installing International Dark-Sky Association-compliant exterior lighting;	making enhancements to the lighting and accessibility of the adjacent Penn Avenue pedestrian entrance;	improving the interior lighting; and	restoring and reopening the blue bedroom on the second floor.

Clayton Porch Project (2017-2019)
Clayton, the home of the Frick family in Pittsburgh from 1883–1905, embodies the extravagant, eclectic fashion of the Gilded Age in America and the materials and craftsmanship that exemplify that era.	In collaboration with the architectural firm MacLachlan Cornelius & Filoni and specialist contractors, the Frick is undertaking a large-scale conservation project addressing two prominent features of the facade of Clayton, which date to the 1892 renovation of the home by Pittsburgh architect Frederick J. Osterling: the Penn Avenue entrance area and the Enclosed Front Porch.	The northern approach to the house features cascading sandstone staircases on the east and west sides and a brightly colored, ornamental terrazzo flooring panel at its landing. The stone railing is adorned with a quatrefoil motif that reoccurs throughout the facade of the building, as seen from Penn Avenue. The arcaded front porch, enclosed in 1899, contains an intricate coffered oak ceiling, Corinthian columns, and a marble mosaic floor designed with a fleur-de-lis pattern, attributed to the well-reputed, Pittsburgh-based mosaic artist Achille Giamartini.	The overarching philosophy of this conservation effort is to minimize intervention into the historic surfaces and to employ a combination of historic masonry techniques, science, and innovation to preserve Clayton. The house itself is treated as an artifact, and our goal is to devise methods of treatment that counteract the effects of time and the environment on the structure and the inherent vice of the materials, systems, and techniques used in its construction. Inherent vice is a term conservators and preservationists use to describe the inevitable self-destruct mechanism in materials or combinations of materials in a system that causes them to deteriorate. To a degree, inherent vice is present in virtually all systems and materials and is a determining factor in approaches taken to maintain a building.	Preliminary work includes removal of the stone steps and masonry at the entrance to the house, the addition of steel supports underneath the porch and attendant repairs to adjacent masonry elements. After these structural repairs are complete, the reassembly of the entry steps will be followed by conservation of the flooring surfaces.	MBM Contracting will act as General Contractor for the project and Brace Engineering will provide structural engineering supervision. The historic terrazzo and mosaic flooring surfaces have undergone treatments by McKay Lodge (Oberlin, OH) and Materials Conservation (Philadelphia, PA), two conservation firms that specialize in the conservation of historic architecture. The terrazzo will be installed and restored by terrazzo restorer Stephen Malone (Harrisburg, PA). Mariani & Richards will perform masonry restoration of the historic stonework. They received a restoration and preservation award from the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworks (BAC) for their work on St. Paul’s Cathedral in Pittsburgh.
This project is supported in part by the Allegheny Regional Asset District.
Clayton Chimney Repairs (2022-2023)
You will notice scaffolding around Clayton, the historic home of the Pittsburgh industrialist and internationally distinguished art collector Henry Clay Frick. From August 2022 through May 2023, all five chimneys will be repaired.
Masons will repoint the brick chimneys.	Architectural preservationists will take samples of the original paint.	Those samples will strengthen our understanding of the original paint colors.	The architectural preservationists will also test a new paint-like product and carefully monitor it over the course of the next year.	The results of that test will inform our future plans to repaint the entire exterior of Clayton.

Driving While Black: Researching the Great Migration
October 7, 2020

Driving While Black: Researching the Great Migration
Last month the Frick was fortunate to sit down (virtually, of course!) with Dr. Gretchen Sorin, distinguished professor and Director of the Cooperstown Graduate Program in Museum Studies. We discussed her new book
Driving While Black: African American Travel and the Road to Civil Rights
. The book—which chronicles how the automobile fundamentally changed African-American life—is an essential read for anyone who seeks a better understanding of African-Americans’ discrimination while driving.
Sorin, G. S. (2020).	Driving while Black: African American Travel and the Road to Civil Rights	. New York, NY: Liveright Publishing Corporation, a division of W.W. Norton & Company.
Dr. Sorin discusses the complexities of simple tasks such as navigating hotel and restaurant accommodations or planning for a family vacation—activities many of us take for granted. In the book, Dr. Sorin references her family trips as a child, still in her pajamas, loading up the car in the middle of the night and heading south to visit family. This particular memory was entirely relatable to me. I could also remember as a child grabbing my pillow and a stuffed animal, climbing into the backseat of our Subaru at two or three in the morning, my mom with sandwiches packed for the ride down the New Jersey Turnpike. The difference in our two stories is that while my dad wanted to get on the road to avoid traffic, Gretchen’s family chose to travel in the early morning hours because it was harder for would-be harassers to determine a motorist’s skin color at night.

Driving While Black
illustrates the importance of the automobile in the everyday lives of African Americans. After the emancipation of enslaved people in the 1870s, the Reconstructionist government of the south enacted and enforced laws that segregated and continued the subjugation of newly freed African Americans. While enslaved, these men and women required authorization before traveling away from the plantation. Slave patrols served to protect the landowner’s property (the enslaved) and ensured that African Americans could not travel freely without first being granted permission.

Once freed, African Americans continued to face traveling restrictions in the form of segregated public transportation. Jim Crow laws relegated African Americans to second-class citizens requiring they ride in segregated train cars or sit in the back seats of buses and trolleys. Those who dared to challenge these laws faced insult, personal injury, arrest, and even death at the hands of angry white passengers, drivers, and law enforcement. Accessibility to private transportation not only lessened the humiliation and physical dangers African American’s endured on public transit, but it also provided them the independence and freedom of mobility that whites had always been privy.

Although this new mobility allowed African Americans to free themselves from public transportation restrictions, they still encountered segregated businesses that affected their ability for comfortable travel both in the south and the north. Discriminatory practices against African-Americans in the North and Mid-West paralleled the Jim Crow laws that dominated the southern landscape. When traveling, African Americans had to be mindful that some restaurants and hotels would not offer them service; likewise, service stations and restrooms could refuse service based entirely on skin color. To put this in perspective, white motorists planning a week-long family vacation would pack their bags, load up their car, and they would be off. The same trip for an African American family would require a great deal more planning. The trip would include bringing along pillows and blankets to sleep in the car if denied lodging. Packing food and drinks in case restaurants were unwilling to serve them. Since some gas stations refused to serve African Americans, extra water and gas added to the list of things they brought along on their trip. Lastly, a map marked with roads, towns, or counties deemed unsafe due to segregationist violence accompanied the motorists.

To help African American motorists find accommodations around the country, Victor Hugo Green, an African American mail carrier in New York City, began publishing an annual travel guide in 1936 entitled
The Negro Motorist Green-Book
. Mr. Green and his employees would travel the country collecting information about welcoming accommodations and towns and businesses motorists should avoid.
The Green-Book
also highlighted African-American owned restaurants, lodging, resorts, and nightclubs in various cities across the country. In addition to
The
Green-Book
, African American motorists relied on Black-owned newspapers, including the highly acclaimed
Pittsburgh Courier
and the
Chicago Defender
, for lodging and accommodation recommendations. Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964—which aimed to abolish Jim Crow laws and eliminate discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin—
The Green-Book
ceased production in 1967 after providing thirty years of assistance to travelers.
The Green-Book
inspired the 2018 Oscar-award winning film
Green Book
and the 2019 documentary,
The Green Book Guide to Freedom
produced by the Smithsonian Channel.

Since publishing
Driving While Black
, Dr. Sorin has teamed up with filmmaker Ric Burns to create the much-anticipated film adaptation of the book entitled
Driving While Black: Race, Space, and Mobility in America
. The film “examines the history of African Americans on the road from the depths of the Depression to the height of the Civil Rights movement and beyond, exploring along the way the deeply embedded dynamics of race, space, and mobility in America during one of the most turbulent and transformative periods in American history.” The documentary will include African Americans’ experiences along with interviews from leading historians, authors, and journalists.
Driving While Black
will air on WQED on Tuesday, October 13th at 9 pm. For more information about the upcoming documentary,

I discovered Dr. Sorin’s book,
Driving While Black
,
while researching an upcoming exhibition for the Car and Carriage Museum. The show—planned for spring 2022—will examine the effect automobile ownership has had on African Americans’ lives and its role in the Great Migration. The period known as the Great Migration took place from the end of the Civil War (the 1870s) through the early 1970s when six million African Americans migrated to the north and west, seeking better employment opportunities in the budding steel and automobile industries while escaping discriminatory laws in the south. Although they still faced discrimination in the north, access to a more equitable life made the journey worthwhile.

Purchasing a car was one of the first things African Americans bought as they moved into the middle class. Automobile ownership provided a real sense of freedom. It was freedom from the restraints of slavery, freedom from timetables of trains and busses, and most important was the freedom of unrestricted mobility, the ability to come and go as one pleases. In the book, Dr. Sorin references a quote from the
Pittsburgh Courier
that stated the key to the movement (referring to the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s) was a key to an automobile. It was true for the suffrage movement in the 1910s, it was true for mobilizing the vote in the 1960s, and is true for any movement or people seeking freedom.

Through this upcoming exhibition and hopefully many more like it, the Car and Carriage Museum will aid in furthering The Frick Pittsburgh’s recent commitments to inclusion and the Black Lives Matter movement. One way to make the exhibition more inclusive is to incorporate the stories of everyday people just like you. I want to include YOUR images and YOUR experiences in this undertaking. I’m looking for pictures of individuals/families posed with their cars accompanied by travel experiences—good and bad—that can help me tell the stories of this period. If you are willing to share, please email them to me at
kcady@thefrickpittsburgh.org
(all information will be kept private, and contributors may remain anonymous).
I’ve compiled a list below (by no means complete) of recommended readings and museum sites for those interested in learning more about the Great Migration and the discriminatory practices faced by African Americans from the time of slavery to the present. For science fiction fans, I recommend
Lovecraft Country
, which combines the monsters of author H.P. Lovecraft with the real-life monsters of the 1950s. I also welcome any of your suggestions and recommendations for further readings or viewings on the topic at
kcady@thefrickpittsburgh.org

Since publishing
Driving While Black
, Dr. Sorin has teamed up with filmmaker Ric Burns to create the much-anticipated film adaptation of the book entitled
Driving While Black: Race, Space, and Mobility in America
. The film “examines the history of African Americans on the road from the depths of the Depression to the height of the Civil Rights movement and beyond, exploring along the way the deeply embedded dynamics of race, space, and mobility in America during one of the most turbulent and transformative periods in American history.” The documentary will include African Americans’ experiences along with interviews from leading historians, authors, and journalists.
Driving While Black
will air on WQED on Tuesday, October 13th at 9 pm. For more information about the upcoming documentary,

I discovered Dr. Sorin’s book,
Driving While Black
,
while researching an upcoming exhibition for the Car and Carriage Museum. The show—planned for spring 2022—will examine the effect automobile ownership has had on African Americans’ lives and its role in the Great Migration. The period known as the Great Migration took place from the end of the Civil War (the 1870s) through the early 1970s when six million African Americans migrated to the north and west, seeking better employment opportunities in the budding steel and automobile industries while escaping discriminatory laws in the south. Although they still faced discrimination in the north, access to a more equitable life made the journey worthwhile.

Purchasing a car was one of the first things African Americans bought as they moved into the middle class. Automobile ownership provided a real sense of freedom. It was freedom from the restraints of slavery, freedom from timetables of trains and busses, and most important was the freedom of unrestricted mobility, the ability to come and go as one pleases. In the book, Dr. Sorin references a quote from the
Pittsburgh Courier
that stated the key to the movement (referring to the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s) was a key to an automobile. It was true for the suffrage movement in the 1910s, it was true for mobilizing the vote in the 1960s, and is true for any movement or people seeking freedom.

Through this upcoming exhibition and hopefully many more like it, the Car and Carriage Museum will aid in furthering The Frick Pittsburgh’s recent commitments to inclusion and the Black Lives Matter movement. One way to make the exhibition more inclusive is to incorporate the stories of everyday people just like you. I want to include YOUR images and YOUR experiences in this undertaking. I’m looking for pictures of individuals/families posed with their cars accompanied by travel experiences—good and bad—that can help me tell the stories of this period. If you are willing to share, please email them to me at
kcady@thefrickpittsburgh.org
(all information will be kept private, and contributors may remain anonymous).
I’ve compiled a list below (by no means complete) of recommended readings and museum sites for those interested in learning more about the Great Migration and the discriminatory practices faced by African Americans from the time of slavery to the present. For science fiction fans, I recommend
Lovecraft Country
, which combines the monsters of author H.P. Lovecraft with the real-life monsters of the 1950s. I also welcome any of your suggestions and recommendations for further readings or viewings on the topic at

Bringing the Carriages Home:  A New Carriage House for the Collection
This year, the Frick is celebrating 30 years since the opening of Clayton and the creation of The Frick Pittsburgh and 50 years since the opening of The Frick Art Museum. When Clayton opened to the public in September 1990, the site looked a bit different than it does today. The store and visitors’ center were in the children’s playhouse, and the Car and Carriage Museum, which was first constructed in 1997 and expanded in 2015, was, at that time, simply called the Carriage Museum. Here, Assistant Curator Kim Cady tells the story of how the carriages got a museum of their own.
Helen Clay Frick began planning for the grounds of her family home to be preserved as a historic site in the years following her father’s 1919 death. By the early 1950s, that planning began to take shape. Helen took the first steps toward this goal through the preservation of her family’s collection of horse-drawn carriages and sleighs. Prior to the razing of Eagle Rock, the Frick family’s summer home on Boston’s north shore, in 1969, and the selling of the Iron Rail Vacation Home for Girls in Wenham, Massachusetts (a retreat created by Helen for young working women from the mill towns around Boston), Helen constructed a building on the grounds of her family home in Pittsburgh in 1955 to house the carriage collection, which had been in storage at Eagle Rock.
Much like sports cars and luxury automobiles today, carriages were a mobile accessory in the arsenal of the affluent to display their wealth. Since carriages were utilized for specific functions or interests—formal occasions, pleasure driving, and sporting events—multiple carriages in various styles were purchased. Henry Clay Frick purchased the oldest of the carriages—a Brougham by Brewster & Co.—in December 1881 while on his honeymoon in New York City with his new bride Adelaide Howard Childs Frick. Over time, the family amassed a rather sizable collection of carriages to accommodate their various activities. Records show that while the Fricks purchased numerous high-end carriages from coachbuilders like Brewster & Co in New York, Wm. D. Rodgers & Sons in Philadelphia, and L. Glesenkamp & Sons in Pittsburgh, they also owned vehicles of simpler construction like t-carts, piano-box body carriages, sleighs, and a dog cart used by the Frick children.

While living at Clayton, the carriages served utilitarian functions, taking Henry to the Homewood train station for work downtown, while Adelaide used the carriages for shopping, or calling upon her sister Attie or nearby friends. Adelaide and Helen also drove the carriages for pleasure in Schenley and Highland Parks. At the start of the summer season the carriages and horses were transported by rail from Pittsburgh to the Frick’s summer rental on Boston’s north shore and returned the same way at the end of the season. Once the construction of Eagle Rock was completed, the family’s carriages were transported to the stables at Eagle Rock where they remained. In addition to the carriages from Pittsburgh, the family continued to purchase carriages and sleighs through 1909, from Brewster & Co in New York City and the French Carriage Company in Boston, Massachusetts. The vast grounds at Eagle Rock provided greater opportunity for pleasure driving than offered at the family homes in Pittsburgh or New York City.

Helen began concentrated planning for the future of Clayton, its grounds, and her father’s legacy in the 1950s. In 1954 she sought an architect to design a museum-storage building on the grounds of Clayton that would be used to house the family’s carriage collection. At this time there were carriages stored at the stables of Eagle Rock, as well as in an outbuilding on the grounds of the Iron Rail Vacation Home for Girls, and at Helen’s residence in Bedford, New York. There was a bit of an impetus to get the carriages transferred from the Iron Rail location because Helen was donating the land to the Girls Club of America.

Business manager and Frick Foundation Trustee Walter F. Cooley worked with N. E. Thompson, an engineer at Eagle Rock, to conduct an inventory of the carriages held at the various Frick properties. N. E. Thompson recorded the measurements and a brief description of 12 carriages, two sleighs, and two cars that were stored at the Massachusetts properties. Helen and Walter worked with the architectural firm Mt. Lebanon Builders to construct a suitable storage facility for the carriages that could be developed into a carriage museum in the future. The original plans had a single-story structure located closer to Homewood Avenue that would accommodate the carriages, gardener’s tools, and two cars. Once Walter and Helen reviewed the dimensions of the carriages, sleighs, and cars, they realized that a two story building was needed to accommodate the collection. Helen was proactive in ensuring the safety of the vehicles and visited a local historical society to determine the best materials to use in the construction—Helen’s preference was for a cinder block building with brick facing, terrazzo floors, and plastered walls.

Once the building—which today serves as the Frick’s education classrooms and office space for Learning & Visitor Experience staff—was complete, the unrestored collection of thirteen carriages and two sleighs was installed. Unfortunately, I am not able to determine at this time when the final, fourteenth, carriage joined the collection, perhaps one carriage had remained at Clayton through the years. Similarly, from N. E. Thompson’s description of the carriages it is difficult to determine if the final carriage was the 1900 four-passenger phaeton, the 1908 Chubb, or 1908 dos-a-dos. A total of fifteen horse drawn vehicles were hoisted onto the second floor of the carriage museum. The two cars—a 1914 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost and a 1931 Lincoln Model K dual cowl phaeton—which were purchased for or by Helen were stored in the Haller House garage—today that building is the Café at the Frick.

Throughout the years, Helen offered private tours of the carriages to family and friends, but it was not open to the general public until after Helen’s death. In 1986 the Frick Foundation brought in Merri Ferrell, the carriage collection curator for the Museums at Stony Brook in Long Island, for a curatorial evaluation and to compile condition reports for the collection in preparation for the opening of the carriage museum. After the plans for the public interpretation of Clayton were complete in 1989, focus turned to the carriage museum. Executive Director DeCourcy McIntosh and Clayton restoration project manager Joanne Moore met with the President of the Carriage Association of America Frank Morrow to design an exhibition plan for the carriage collection. The three decided to change the façade of the brick building to resemble the aesthetic of the rest of the site, and hired UDA Architects in Pittsburgh for the new design which incorporated a stucco finish and carriage house style doors—reminiscent of the original Clayton stables.

Since opening to the public on September 25, 1990, the museum has undergone two expansions, the first in 1997 to accommodate the loan of the G. Whitney Snyder collection of antique automobiles (which later were donated to the museum) and again in 2015 to create a more appropriate display space for the carriages—with higher ceilings and better lighting, to allow the sculptural forms of the carriages to be seen to better advantage. Today the museum maintains a mixed collection of carriages and cars totaling 40 vehicles, offers free admission, an option of self-guided or docent-led tours (on specific days), and regular temporary exhibitions. What began as a way to preserve one woman’s memories of family, fun, and leisure has become a way for thousands of annual visitors to make their own memories imagining what life must have been like for Helen Clay Frick on her carriage drives.

Preservation, Conservation, and Restoration (Yes, They're Different!) at the Car and Carriage Museum

Preservation, Conservation, and Restoration (Yes, They're Different!) at the Car and Carriage Museum
When walking through the Car and Carriage Museum, you might have noticed that the vehicles are all elevated on jack stands. (If you haven’t, you will now). For those of you who wonder why, I can assure you we are not mechanics working tirelessly on carburetors and engines. The reason we slightly raise the vehicles off the ground is to prevent wear and flat spots on the original rubber of the Frick’s carriages and on the restored tires of our automobile collection.
Measures like these are known as preventive conservation, aims to prevent deterioration before it begins. Preventive conservation is accomplished through many strategies, including: proper storage and exhibition in a controlled climate, temperature and humidity level monitoring, dust mitigation, and pest management. These indirect methods can increase the longevity of the object, preventing the need for more serious conservation interventions that could alter the appearance or structural makeup of the artifact.
Just like our fine and decorative art collections, the collection of vehicles at the Car and Carriage Museum occasionally requires care beyond the routine preventive methods described above. Sometimes objects enter the collection with issues that require time, sufficient funds, and careful attention to address. When objects are being prepared for exhibition, it’s often a good time to bring in the expertise of a conservator to help stabilize, reverse, or cosmetically improve existing damage.

The goal of conservation is to prevent further deterioration and to preserve the original structure of an object as much as possible. Although these treatments sometimes modify the appearance of the object, they ultimately preserve its integrity. Conservators approach their work using current best practices and materials, with professional standards requiring that any treatment be reversible if better methods or materials are discovered through future research.
The increase in temporary exhibitions following the recent gallery expansion at the Car and Carriage Museum has necessitated the use of conservation experts to prepare vehicles for exhibition. In spring 2019 three of the Frick’s carriages received textile conservation before the opening of

. Tears in both the

required repair and stabilization to prevent further damage. Textile conservator Christine Maurhoff Radeshak used non-invasive techniques to mend and reinforce the fabric of the carriages. Likewise, the

sleigh required extensive repairs to the upholstery before going on exhibit for the first time the cutter since its acquisition in 2003.

Although trained staff use great care to ensure the safety of the collections, occasionally accidents happen. Many of the vehicles in the collection are over 100 years old and can suffer damage through everyday activities such as simply moving an object within the gallery. One such incident occurred when relocating the c. 1903 Brewster and Company
Country Omnibus
. The vehicle suffered damage when the original rubber tire separated from the iron felloes. Staff sought the expertise of Brian Howard Conservation Studios for the repair of the tire. Brian Howard and associates are responsible for the conservation of many historic vehicles including an 1864 Wood Brothers
Barouche
carriage that once belonged to President Abraham Lincoln. Curators and conservation staff discussed the best option for repair of the wheel, whether to preserve the original rubber through conservation efforts or use modern materials to create a new, restored tire. To maintain the authenticity of the object, the original rubber was saved and reattached using conservation appropriate adhesive techniques.

If an object suffers a great deal of loss or no longer functions as it once did, whether due to past alterations or deterioration, museums may decide to use restoration methods to return an object to its previous state. Unlike conservation, restoration alters the structure of the object, changes its history, and is often irreversible.
Many of the automobiles at the Frick Car and Carriage Museum are examples of restoration. The automobile collectors who previously owned some of these vehicles chose restoration as a means to return the vehicles both to their original function and beauty. Although restorers aim for historical accuracy—choosing appropriate parts, paint colors, and accessories—the modified vehicle becomes a representation of a vehicle from that period rather than an original. In some instances, the only remaining original component may be the chassis. Restoration isn’t all bad though, as it provides us with an opportunity to see a vehicle that might otherwise be lost to history, especially those with low production numbers such as the Frick’s

In 2018, restoration was used to brighten the brass on the 1909 Stanley Steamer

. Over time, the 109-year-old
Roadster
lost the luster on many of its brass components. Brass polishing can be controversial—since each time a component is polished a bit of the surface is abraded. However, looking at a historic vehicle with dulled brass has a huge impact on the visitor experience. Again, we reached out to historic vehicle specialist Brian Howard Conservation Studios for proper treatment. The vehicle spent several months in the conservation studio where each of the numerous brass components were removed, cleaned, and given a protecting lacquer coating. The lacquer coating (reversible, of course) protects the brass from oxidizing and ensures that it does not require regular polishing to remain bright.

Visitors may notice that the Car and Carriage Museum features many Brass Era vehicles with brass components that have tarnished, and may wonder why other vehicles have not received this restoration treatment. The treatment that the Stanley received is both time consuming and costly; other vehicles may receive treatment in the future, although some may be left with the patinated brass, which illustrates the age and history of the object.

Museums balance the use of preservation, conservation, and restoration to save, exhibit, and interpret objects for the public. Each method serves the purpose of protecting artifacts for the enjoyment and education of current and future museum visitors. Whether a sculpture by Rodin or a Rolls Royce, museums take great care to ensure the safety of their collections. Simple non-invasive methods of cleaning and monitoring can go a long way in the protection and increased longevity of artifacts.

Domestic Archaeology: Uncovering Clayton's Interior Finishes
October 15, 2020

Domestic Archaeology: Uncovering Clayton's Interior Finishes
It’s a common conception that historic house museums are “frozen in time.” But like any home, house museums represent the families who lived within them and reflect their evolving personalities and changing tastes. Think of your own living space. Have you ever painted a room or spent the day peeling layers of wallpaper from a previous resident?
While the exterior structure of Clayton remains largely unchanged since the 1890s, the interior walls witnessed several changes over the years as fashions swung from wallpaper to painted canvas to silk and back again. When Clayton was converted from a private residence to a public house museum, these changes presented architects and conservators with some surprises and challenges.
The interior finishes at Clayton are elaborate and the effect can be overwhelming. As John Robbins, project architect with supervising architectural firm The Office of Thierry W. Despont, described in a 1987 interview with
The Pittsburgh Press
, “Every room that you enter, you’re besieged with an onslaught of exotic finishes.”
1
Few expected that those finishes concealed even more decorations beneath.
Following Helen Clay Frick’s death in 1984, architects and curators began the research and exploratory work to prepare for Clayton’s restoration. In a process one reporter described as “domestic archaeology,” restoration staff carefully examined and removed interior wall coverings, assessing their condition, authenticity, and often revealing surprises that demonstrated previous decorating choices by the Fricks. But these discoveries also posed a conundrum for the restoration staff. As architect Despont described it, “The house went through three stages of renovation, and the question is, to what point do you bring it back? What we’ve decided is to show Clayton as a living thing that has evolved as the family’s tastes developed. So we won’t fix it at a particular year.”
2
In some cases, the hidden finishes were restored in their entirety but in others, they were carefully documented and then secreted away again in favor of a different finish from a different period.
Delving beneath the reception room’s damask wall covering installed by Helen Clay Frick in the 1950s, architects found a beautifully painted frieze of roses on a trellis. It matched the decoration seen in circa 1901 photographs of the room and was original to the expansion and renovation completed by Frederick J. Osterling in 1892.

The reception room was particularly challenging as the most extensively altered of the public spaces on the first floor. While the discovery of the original 1890s frieze was exciting, it was complicated by the fact that none of the original furnishings from the 1890s survived, with the exception of the rug. In 1904, Cottier & Company extensively renovated the space. Decorators provided new fabric wall coverings, draperies, and a marble mantle, raised the wainscoting, refinished the woodwork, and—the most dramatic change—installed an elaborate ceiling and cornice with lacquered and gilded accents.  Restoring the painted canvas frieze and interpreting the space to the 1890s would have necessitated deinstalling or even demolishing many of the later elements which were more complete in their entirety and in remarkably good condition. Ultimately, staff opted to document the frieze and leave it in place behind a newly created silk wall covering designed to match the one provided by Cottier in 1904.

Similarly, evidence of previous decoration was found on the walls of the parlor when a fragment of the velvet wall covering was removed. The decoration clearly relates to what is seen in the circa 1901 photographs of the parlor, also original to the Osterling renovation. But like the reception room, the parlor was extensively renovated by Cottier & Company in 1904. In addition to the velvet wall coverings, decorators gilded sections of the walnut woodwork and installed a new gilded ceiling. The 1890s decoration was in an incomplete state and poor condition. The architects recommended that the parlor’s treatment involve the least amount of alteration and that the room be left as a representative of the decoration from the early 1900s. This decision was made easier by the fact that a 1908 photograph of the room decorated for Helen Clay Frick’s debut showed many of the same objects on view in the circa 1901 photographs, most of which survived. The cut velvet fabric on the lower panels was replaced, but the original velvet frieze adorned with mother-of-pearl sequins and metallic thread remained in place.

Further surprises awaited in the breakfast room. During an exploratory removal of the fabric wall covering, staff discovered plaster tracery behind mauve-colored silk installed by Cottier in 1904. The tracery matched the elaborate decoration accented with aluminum leaf on the ceiling and corresponded to circa 1901 photographs of the room. Although it had been chipped away in some spots to install the fabric, it was overall in remarkably good condition. In this case, architects chose to repair the original tracery ornament which had significance as one of the earliest decorative applications of aluminum in a domestic setting. (To read more about the aluminum decoration, check out
this blog post
.) Expert plaster craftsmen J.J. Morris and Sons recreated the missing tracery in much the same way a pastry chef decorates a cake with piped icing while A.J. Vater and Company helped to restore the original paint scheme.

One more surprise was in store upstairs in the Frick family’s sitting room and library. Dark brown silk wall coverings, once again installed by Cottier & Company in 1904, were discovered to be hiding painted jute tapestries created by Kimbel & Sons during the Osterling renovation in 1892. Because the rooms were otherwise intact to Osterling’s original design, it was a relatively easy decision to remove the later wall coverings and conserve the painted tapestries.

Other rooms were far more straightforward. Henry Clay Frick’s bedroom, the nursery, and blue room all retained their original painted canvas decorated by Kimbel & Sons to Osterling’s specifications in 1892. But there was still work to be done, as these walls were coated with 100 years of Pittsburgh soot and grime. Varnish, which had yellowed over time, distorted the original colors. Some rooms had been conserved or repainted over the years, but the quality of those treatments varied.

Conservators assessed the condition of each room’s wall decoration and suggested appropriate treatments to restore them to a state more closely resembling their original appearance. First, conservators removed the top surface layers of dirt and grime, testing small areas to ensure the cleaning solvents would not adversely react to the painted canvas. In some areas, the canvas had loosened and was pulling away from the walls. In those instances, conservators re-adhered the canvas to the plaster using a hypodermic syringe to inject an adhesive made of wheat starch paste. Some areas needed to be infilled and repainted due to losses, which conservators completed using reversible acrylic paints. They then layered the repainted areas with a patina to match the surrounding canvas and appear appropriately aged.

The restoration of each room required careful deliberation and methodical skill. Since the restoration’s staff approach was not to fix Clayton to one particular time period, that allowed them flexibility to make the choice that would be the least invasive to the surviving architecture and allow for the greatest degree of authenticity in showcasing the home as an evolving embodiment of the Frick family’s tastes. But determining what should be preserved was not always an easy choice. Some of Clayton’s history will always remain hidden from view.

The Frick celebrates	TENDER: a literary anthology and book of spells: evidence	, and what comes next.
October 1, 2020

The Frick celebrates	TENDER: a literary anthology and book of spells: evidence	, and what comes next.
The Frick Pittsburgh has always been an institution grounded in history and Gilded Age lore—the Frick family, the stories of their lives, and their legacy has been at the center of the narrative. Our beautiful historical site and grounds that was once a home, and the objects that build a tangible story of this family’s life remains; we are now, in earnest, stepping into the task of working forward. By listening, by making relationships with those around us, by honoring stories that haven’t been told by people who have not been allowed to be in the light. By offering ourselves as a partner, as a safe place to tell every story, and as a place willing to do the work to be better.
Anthologies often highlight works that have long been published, a collection of curated work highlighting a particular theme, literary movement, region, era, etc.  It is not quite as common that an anthology is created as an “of-the-moment” response born of longing, the need to speak up, and as a tool to encourage healing. But that is just what
TENDER
is.
Published in 2019, before we were living in a global health crisis and before the world woke up, just a little bit more, to the social injustice and ravages of white supremacy and police brutality, the writers of
TENDER
were offering up this anthology of the stories of an existing, ever-morphing landscape of Black womenx and femme creatives.
Rather than a compendium or a reference guide to past work,
TENDER
reads like a living snapshot of the world of Black womenx and femme writers and visual artists with Pittsburgh as its epicenter. Some of the stories, phrases, or images conjured by each of these 19 womenx, though chronicling the past and imagining the future, transport the reader to the exact moment we are living in now. And this is why the Frick Pittsburgh is grateful for the opportunity to give the community another way in which these stories and these incredible womenx can be seen and heard.
In this three-part program, the Frick welcomes the editors of and many of the contributors to
TENDER—
they will be in discussion, in community, and will be sharing published and new work.  Beyond the final products, the series will look at the artists’ processes and practices, as well as open up a discussion about the art ecosystem in Pittsburgh and what will come next for these powerful, inspired womenx.
From the editors:
About
TENDER a literary anthology & book of spells: evidence
This collection of poetry, prose, and art by Black womxn and femmes in Pittsburgh grew out of a longing for connection and comfort in a city and a world that is not always tender toward them. The book is a balm they made for themselves. The collection is edited and published by Vanessa German and Deesha Philyaw.
TENDER
is brought to you by late-night conversations among Black womxn and femmes telling our stories, talking about us, loving on us. Conversations of reckoning and consideration of the heart and the soul and how we are living with ourselves, friends, family, and lovers, through times of stress and social media and false media. This book is brought to you by healing hands, prayers, loud laughter, and freestyles.

Making the Car and Carriage Museum: A Look at Our Past and What's Driving Our Future

Making the Car and Carriage Museum: A Look at Our Past and What's Driving Our Future

Seven years after the carriage museum opened in 1990, Director DeCourcy McIntosh and the board of trustees decided to expand the gallery. This decision aimed to provide a greater viewing area for the Frick family carriages and Helen Clay Frick’s automobiles, a 1914 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, and a 1931 Lincoln Model K Dual Cowl Phaeton. Before the 1997 expansion, the carriage house, a 20’ x 30’ building constructed in 1955, displayed all 15 Frick-owned carriages. This space provided storage for the collection but did not allow for interpretation or a way for visitors to view the vehicles safely. Also, the carriage house did not provide space for the exhibition of Helen’s cars, stored at the time in the Haller House garage, what is today the Café at the Frick.
During this time, working with the Pittsburgh Historic & Landmark Foundation, industrialist and antique automobile collector G. Whitney Snyder was developing a museum focusing on the history of transportation in Pittsburgh and the Western Pennsylvania region. G. Whitney and his brother, William Penn Snyder III, were the grandsons of William Penn Snyder. W. P. Snyder founded the Shenango Furnace Company in 1906 to manufacture pig-iron and coke, both components used to make steel. G. Whitney and W.P. Snyder III both held governing positions in the Shenango Furnace Company. They were active in philanthropic causes in the Western Pennsylvania region, including healthcare and education initiatives and the arts. In addition to their philanthropy, the Snyder brothers were active and avid antique automobile collectors and restorers. G. Whitney’s love and appreciation of automobiles began at a young age when, on his 16th birthday, he received a 1937 American Bantam Roadster as a gift.

In the 1950s, the Snyder brothers worked together to locate an 1898 Panhard et Levassor Tonneau purchased in France by Howard Heinz, son of H. J. Heinz, that same year, and believed to be one of the first cars to travel the roads of Pittsburgh. Found behind a false wall in the basement of a property owned by the Heinz family, G. Whitney Snyder restored the car to operable condition. He renewed its customized finish of ketchup red body, pickle green spokes, and mustard yellow trim. In April 1979, the restored Tonneau exhibited at the Old Post Office Museum on the Northside. When the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum opened in that space in the late 1980s, G. Whitney Snyder, a trustee of the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, began plans for a museum honoring Pittsburgh’s rich transportation history.

The Station Square Transportation Museum opened in October 1985 in Bessemer Court at Station Square, repurposing a boiler house that belonged to the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad. In addition to a collection of vehicles—cars, carriages, and motorcycles—the small 60’ x 40’ retrofitted building exhibited transportation memorabilia and historical photographs until the late 1990s when the property at Station Square underwent a redesign for commercial development.

It is fortuitous then that G. Whitney Snyder, President of the Station Square Transportation Museum, was looking for a new home for his collection of antique automobiles while the Frick was looking to expand its carriage house museum. In 1996, the Frick hired the Pittsburgh architect firm of Landmark Design Associates to further develop the existing carriage museum constructed in 1955. The firm had previously worked with Mr. Snyder on the Station Square Transportation Museum. The expansion tripled the display area for the cars and carriages, adding an L-shaped structure adjacent to the existing carriage house. The remodeled carriage house also included a theater space that provided an orientation video on Pittsburgh’s automobile history for visitors.

The Car and Carriage Museum project was completed in 1997. In that year, the Station Square Transportation Museum gifted the restored Heinz Panhard et Levassor Tonneau and a 1930 Ford Model A Coupe to the museum. Virginia and Donald Burnham gifted a 1903 Baker Electric Stanhope that same year, and Violanda LaBate donated a c.1916 Chevrolet Model 490 touring car. In addition to the Panhard and Model A Coupe, G. Whitney Snyder lent numerous vehicles from his collection to the museum, including a 1910 Brush Model 10 Runabout, c. 1924 Peugeot Quadrilette, and 1931 American Austin Coupe, providing the museum with an excellent selection of brass and pre-war era automobiles. At Mr. Snyder’s death in 1999, he bequeathed the fourteen brass and pre-war vehicles on loan to the museum, including a 1924 Auto Red Bug Flyer and 1912 Daimler Landaulette. The museum acquired additional vehicles from local collectors. In 1999, Laurie Graham donated a 1909 Stanley steam car Roadster, and Sam McClung gifted a 1910 Buick Model 10 Runabout. The museum received two vehicles from William Penn Snyder III, a 1922 Lincoln Model L 104, and a 1923 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost Salamanca Town Car that had belonged to his grandmother. The new variety of vehicles, coupled with the additional gallery space, allowed the museum to develop temporary exhibits providing visitors with a greater understanding of transportation history.

An expansion of the Car and Carriage Museum in 2015 sought to broaden the museum’s audience and outreach. The former carriage house (the 1955 building) became state-of-the-art classrooms for school and adult learning groups. This new space is a place for thousands of students who visit the Frick each year through school programs and camps to explore primary sources, discuss the collections they are seeing, and make art. The classrooms also offer a space for adult learners to more deeply explore topics related to the permanent collection and temporary exhibits through lectures, panel discussions, and workshops.

An addition to the car gallery (the 1997 addition) accommodated the carriages removed to make room for the new classrooms. Although the inclusion of the Education Center eliminated the orientation theater, Pittsburgh and the Automobile, along with other videos and stories, can be found on iPads within the gallery, which provide visitors with an opportunity to engage with the permanent and temporary exhibitions.
Today, the Car and Carriage Museum interprets the social history of transportation and how the carriage and later access to the automobile transformed the way people worked and traveled, providing access and opportunity to many. Recent exhibitions in the Car and Carriage Museum focused on the automobile’s role in fighting for women’s right to vote and another on specialized carriages used for sport and leisure. In the coming months and years, the museum will continue to develop exhibitions that will provide visitors with a greater understanding of transportation history and its relevance today. In April 2021, we will examine the art of hood ornaments and their use in personalization and reflective individualism in the exhibition
Cast in Chrome
. The following spring, we will focus on the role the automobile played in the lives of African Americans traveling in and out of the Jim Crow South during the Great Migration. Future exhibitions include labor relations in the auto industry with a focus on Pittsburgh and Western PA made cars, and an exploration of the importance of car culture in the Latinx community. While designed to promote self-guided tours, the museum does offer docent lead tours of permanent and temporary exhibitions for those visitors who want to gain more insight. While these public tours are currently on pause for visitor and staff safety during the coronavirus pandemic, we look forward to bringing our interpretive staff back to the galleries for future exhibitions.

Thank you for traveling along with me as we looked back at the development of the Frick’s Car and Carriage Museum. I hope you will continue to follow us as we venture and navigate our road of diverse transportation exhibitions.
The Car and Carriage museum reopens to members and essential workers on Saturday, August 15, and to the general public on Saturday, August 22. Free, timed tickets are required for entry, and can be reserved up to three days in advance of visit date.

Cast in Chrome: The Art of Hood Ornaments
Over the history of motoring, hood ornaments evolved from the practical (externally mounted radiator caps) to the purely decorative. Today, only a few luxury brands continue the tradition. Why were hood ornaments so popular and what led to their demise?	Cast in Chrome	at the Frick Car and Carriage Museum takes a look at the evolution of these decorative automobile elements. What began as a means to monitor radiator temperature became a way of displaying status and personalizing vehicles. The popularity of these adornments was not lost on manufacturers, who saw an opportunity for branding, creating factory hood ornaments associated with specific makes and models.	Cast in Chrome	explores the relationship between car makes and hood ornament designs, looks at the artists who sculpted these miniature works of art, and examines their decline in popularity.	The exhibition is organized thematically, with sections devoted to the female figure, animals, mythology, art-deco-inspired motifs, and the great space race—when airplanes and rockets made their way onto hoods. Each theme is accompanied by a featured automobile marque from the 1920s or 1930s, a selection of illustrative hood ornaments, and clothing from the period. This special exhibition features the famous Spirit of Ecstasy, the well-known mascot of Rolls-Royce, represented by the Frick’s 1923 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Salamanca town car. Also included is Helen Clay Frick’s 1931 Lincoln Model K Dual Cowl Phaeton with greyhound ornament. Four additional cars will be on loan to the Frick, along with about 30 additional hood ornaments.

Jewels of Denial: A Look at British Suffrage Jewelry

Jewels of Denial: A Look at British Suffrage Jewelry
Kim Cady, Assistant Curator, Car and Carriage Museum, is our resident expert on women’s suffrage, having previously curated the exhibition	Driving the Disenfranchised: The Automobile’s Role in Women’s Suffrage	. Here, prompted by two of the objects included in the exhibition	Maker & Muse: Women and Early Twentieth Century Art Jewelry	, she takes a closer look at the jewelry that symbolized a woman’s dedication to the cause.
"An idea that is driven home to the mind through the eye, produces a more striking and lasting impression than any that goes through the ear." Glenna Tinnin, National American Woman Suffrage Association
"The March of the Women" by Ethel Smyth. Courtsey Getty Images.
The British suffrage movement mirrored that of the American women’s fight for access to the polls. Having begun in the mid-19th century, the British suffrage movement stalled until the early 20th century, when momentum picked up and sentiments for suffrage shifted in favor of the franchise for women. Like the American suffrage movement, those fighting for women’s rights differed, with one faction seeking the vote through political persuasion and the other through civil disobedience. In addition to civil disobedience—and occasional violence—the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU), led by Emmeline Pankhurst, believed that unification through visual appearance spoke as loudly as the speeches the suffragettes were giving in the streets.

The women of the suffrage movement were often labeled unladylike, troublemakers, boorish, and spinsters. To combat these criticisms, Emmeline Pankhurst encouraged members of the WSPU to dress their best when protesting and marching. She recommended they align themselves outwardly with Edwardian ideals of femininity while publicly engaging in defiant activities that would be labeled as masculine.

To unify members of the WSPU and supporters of the movement, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, the business manager of the WPSU and editor of the
Votes for Women
newspaper decreed in 1908 purple, white, and green the colors of the suffrage movement.
“Purple as everyone knows is the royal colour. It stands for the royal blood that flows in the veins of every suffragette, the instinct of freedom and dignity; white stands for purity in private and public life; green is the colour of hope and the emblem of spring.” Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Women's Social and Political Union
Although perhaps not part of Pethick-Lawrence’s original thinking, by January 1910, the National Women’s Trade Union League publication, the
Union Labor Advocate,
was promoting the colors—green, white, and violet—as an acrostic meant to convey the message (G)ive (W)omen (V)otes.
The suffragettes were one of the first organized movements to use merchandising and symbolism as propaganda. The color combination in varying shades and the messaging of the colors quickly caught on with many women exhibiting them. The colors were found on anything from soaps and chocolates to scarves and hosiery and incorporated into jewelry design.
Jessie Marion King designed Suffragette Pendant, Liberty & Company.
The jewelry described as suffragette falls into many categories—arts and crafts or mass-produced, it could be costume or precious, medals, brooches, pins, and things in between. Pieces were created by traditional jewelers and goldsmiths as well as women working from their homes. Some historians suggest that Jewelry was a subtle way to express support for the cause while maintaining peace at home if the wearer’s father or husband disapproved of women’s suffrage. Other scholars believe that the color combination of purple, white, and green was widely known to represent the suffrage movement and the suffragettes; it was not subtle but instead deliberate.

Semi-precious stones such as amethyst, moonstone, pearl, and chalcedony (a green gemstone) were selected for high-end luxury pieces, and glass beads or colored stones were used for the less expensive objects. From an aesthetic standpoint, the chosen colors of purple, white, and green were visually pleasing; purple and green are complementary colors on the color wheel. The discovery in Russia’s Ural Mountains of demantoid garnet, a bright green gemstone, led to demantoid fever with an explosion of the gemstone in Edwardian and Art Nouveau designs. Likewise, both the green gemstone peridot and the purple precious stone amethyst were said to be the favorites of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, respectively.

It was common for women to wear pins on their coats or other jewelry in the suffragette colors when attending rallies. Some chose a beaded necklace in purple, white, and green, a brooch made of semi-precious stones attached to a high-collared blouse, or a simple tin badge with Emmeline Pankhurst’s image adorned with tri-color ribbons.

A Medal of Valor was made honoring those women who endured hunger strikes while imprisoned for protesting. A purple, white, and green ribbon included attachable bars that indicated the date and length of incarceration. The hanging medallion read “hunger strike” with the woman’s name engraved on the reverse.

Sylvia Pankhurst, Emmeline’s daughter, designed a brooch that depicted the portcullis (the symbol of the House of Commons), a broad arrow (the convict symbol) in purple, white, and green enamel, and hanging chains. The brooch was given to those suffragettes who had been incarcerated at Holloway Prison. The brooch was referred to as the Holloway Prison brooch, the Portcullis badge, and the Victoria Cross of the Union.

Due to a lack of documentation, it cannot be known for certain how many pieces of fine jewelry of the era qualify as Suffragette Jewelry. Some pieces were made specifically for leaders of the party, but many more examples exist that were merely purchased with the intent to be worn in support of the cause. The stylish jewelry became an important part of identity for WSPU members, a way to communicate their solidarity without words.

Each piece of jewelry, though personal, was a visual representation of a woman’s support for the movement and unified them behind the cause of suffrage. The marketing tools shifted from pamphlets and banners that could be discarded after a rally to heirlooms that could be handed down from one generation to next, a reminder of the strength of our foremothers and the continued fight for ourselves.

Students Inspired by Still Life
Middle school students participating in Manchester Craftsmen's Guild virtual summer class "Plant One On Me" were exposed to the art of macro photography by instructors Kelly Lanzendorfer and Germaine Watkins. Students got up close and personal with organic objects. They started by taking pictures of various plants in and outside of their houses during quarantine. Assignments then led to taking pictures of their lunch and dinner. That’s when students really showed their creativity. They began to look closer, naturally creating artistic expressions from routine life.
An idea for a collaboration (like our previous
Cars and Cameras
collaboration) between MCG and the Frick began to form. In honor of World Photography Day on August 19, students were instructed to examine Jan van Os's painting
Still Life with Fruit
and produce their own photographic interpretations. These could be literal or figurative, inspired purely by the visuals of the painting, or incorporate additional research into the work, artist, and still life genre.

Disease and Illness in Gilded Age Pittsburgh: Part Two
August 4, 2020
By:	Sue Morris, Clayton Docent
The Fricks Afflicted
In late 19th and early 20th century Pittsburgh, the burden of illness and disease was disproportionately borne by those who lived in substandard conditions and had limited access to health care. But Pittsburgh’s wealthiest residents were not immune. The families of Henry Clay Frick and Adelaide Howard Childs, even with their considerable privileges, were beset by the illnesses and conditions of daily life.
Over a thirteen-month period spanning 1891–1892, Henry Clay and Adelaide Howard Childs Frick lost two of their four children. A reasonable conclusion can be drawn from Frick family history that a virulent infection contributed to oldest daughter Martha’s death a week before her 6th birthday. Newborn Henry Clay Frick Jr. died of unknown causes a few weeks after birth. Child mortality was the great social leveler of the day, indiscriminately snuffing out the lives of children from both rich and poor families. Records from 1877 through 1895 attribute 40% of the total mortality of the Pittsburgh area to the deaths of children under the age of five years. Wealth may have allowed the Fricks to live a life of advantages most Pittsburghers didn’t have, but grief over the losses of their children gave them common company.

The adult Fricks suffered from various ailments throughout their adult lives, too. Repeated and disabling bouts of rheumatoid arthritis left Henry Clay Frick bedridden for extended periods. Chronic back problems plagued Adelaide Frick. Like many wealthy individuals of their day, they sought
healing visits to fabulous spas
and warm climates.
The Fricks were also adherents of homeopathy. Today, homeopathic medicine is an alternative treatment philosophy, but back then it was popular and essentially mainstream. Considering that this was a period characterized by the lack of standard antiseptic conditions or drug oversight, many people felt they had better odds of surviving if they took minimal doses of medication and avoided hospitals. At the dawn of the 20th century in the United States, there were nearly 15,000 homeopathic practitioners and 22 homeopathic schools.
Adelaide Howard Childs Frick had good reason to place her faith in homeopathy since her older half-brother William Riddle Childs was an esteemed physician. He was a graduate of Washington & Jefferson College and Hahneman Homeopathic Medical College in Philadelphia. Along with classmate J.H. McClelland, who would later serve as personal physician to the Frick family, W.R. Childs was one of the founding physicians of the precursor to Shadyside Hospital, the Homoeopathic Medical and Surgical Hospital and Dispensary, established in 1866 in downtown Pittsburgh.

But this physician son could not heal his father, Asa Partridge Childs, who died in 1878 of typhoid fever at the age of 74.
The Childs family settled in Pittsburgh, moving from New England, in 1817, when Asa was 13 years old. Along with two brothers, he had prospered as co-owner of various cotton and leather goods manufacturers and flour mills. Asa retired from active business in his 60s to this gracious Greek Revival-style home along today’s Forbes Avenue, located at the present location of Magee Hospital.

Nineteenth-century Pittsburghers didn’t pretend that typhoid fever was exclusively a disease of the lower classes. They understood that it could be contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with fecal matter of an infected person. But in the late 1870s and early 1880s, there was still confusion about the nature of such diseases, as can be seen in this excerpt from an 1880 newspaper article about a typhoid fever outbreak on the Southside. People of the late 19th century struggled to explain and understand the principles of microbiology.
Pittsburgh Daily Post	excerpt, 2 April 1880.
We can’t know how Asa Childs contracted typhoid fever. His home in what was then the wealthy suburb of Oakland was far removed from typical disease epicenters like densely packed Southside. Still, his obituary was unequivocal in attributing his demise to the disease.

Asa Childs was mourned by his 55-year-old widow and ten surviving children from two marriages, who ranged in age from adulthood to age 9. Their lives would have been visibly transformed by the era’s mourning traditions, which sought comfort through performative grieving that included all-black wardrobes to indicate bereaved status. When her father died, Adelaide was 19 years old and three years away from meeting her future husband Henry Clay Frick. There exists a photo of her as a teenager, dressed in the kind of black mourning attire that she would have donned following her father’s death.

Pittsburgh recorded 149 deaths of typhoid fever in 1874, the year Asa died. The actual number may well have been higher, since there was no mandated epidemiological reporting. That wouldn’t begin until 1882, after Pittsburgh documented at least 1284 deaths from typhoid in the preceding nine years. Cases continued to rise, and by 1907 one of every six Pittsburgh residents suffered from typhoid fever. Municipal efforts created basic sewage treatment and water filtration facilities to reduce underlying public health problems, but officials balked at the cost of large-scale proper sewage-treatment programs. It would take until 1945, and the enforcement of state legislation, for Allegheny County to begin to comprehensively address the problem of sewage treatment and disposal with the creation of ALCOSAN (Allegheny County Sanitary Authority).
Other than Adelaide Frick’s father, the family of Henry Clay Frick managed to quite literally escape the prevalent 19th century deadly diseases. From the 1890s on, the Frick family’s year fell into predictable rhythms: months at a time spent at Clayton, alternating with stays in Palm Beach, New York, Boston, and Europe in the most sanitary surroundings. The privilege of the wealthiest classes allowed them mobility and the luxury of leaving town when epidemics flared.

The Art of Hood Ornaments: René Lalique

The Art of Hood Ornaments: René Lalique
While various hood ornaments were available to all car owners in the early 20th century, luxury brand owners wanted their cars to stand out among their peers. To accomplish this, wealthy owners adorned their vehicles with glass ornaments. With its inherent fragility, the use of glass increased the object’s prestige as a rare and decadent purchase. These stylish ornaments became a symbol of affluence and status, and owners had several options for suppliers. In Britain, there was Red-Ashay. French motorists purchased Sabino. In the United States, owners bought from Persons Majestic. Those owners who wanted the most opulent  ornaments, however, sought the designs of French artist René Lalique.
René Lalique (French, 1860–1945).	Coq Nain	(Bantam Rooster) c. 1928. From the Collection of The Henry Ford, Dearborn, Michigan.
Known for his Art Nouveau jewelry and glass perfume bottles, Lalique began creating Art Deco style hood ornaments in the 1920s. He introduced his first ornament in 1925, the
Cinq-Chevaux
(five horses) for Citroën’s 5CV—his only design made for a specific marque. Lalique chose uncolored glass for most of his works and incorporated satin and frosted finishes. On the rare occasion he chose colored glass, he selected shades of pinks, purples, and blues. In
Vitesse
, Lalique used opalescent glass, which gave the object a milky appearance. From the 1920s until his death in 1945, Lalique created 29 hood ornaments. Due to their high cost—approximately $600–900 today—Lalique’s creations graced only the most coveted luxury models such as Bentley, Hispano-Suiza, Bugatti, Isotta-Fraschini, and other similar marques. Lalique’s top-selling ornament and probably his most recognizable is
Victoire
—which epitomizes Art Deco styling.
René Lalique (French, 1860–1945).	Victoire	(Victory), c. 1928. From the Collection of The Henry Ford, Dearborn, Michigan.
Created to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the end of WWI, Lalique introduced
Victoire
on a Minerva automobile at the 1928 Paris Motor Salon. The ornament embodies energy, speed, and motion.
Victoire
denotes a female figure who seems to be facing into the wind, rendered in a way that expresses both the structural interest of Art Deco and aerodynamism—with her hair protruding behind like a sharp wing. Although only her head is visible, one can imagine her body bracing against the force of the wind. The piece stands on its own as a sculpture but doubles as an added  elegant touch to the automobile it adorns.
Like
Victoire
, many of Lalique’s pieces could stand on their own as works of art. He commissioned pedestals from the Breves Gallery in London for his client’s ornaments to be prominently displayed in their homes when not mounted to a  vehicle. Although we often think of cars as primarily functional objects, during the automobile’s golden age these ornaments, as well as the vehicles they adorned, were works of art created by some of the best artisans and industrial designers.
On Tuesday, June 15, at 7 p.m., local artist and jewelry designer Keith Belles will give us a
behind-the-scenes look
at the creation of a hood ornament. Join us for this exciting online artist talk in conjunction with

Cast in Chrome: The Art of Hood Ornaments
Over the history of motoring, hood ornaments evolved from the practical (externally mounted radiator caps) to the purely decorative. Today, only a few luxury brands continue the tradition. Why were hood ornaments so popular and what led to their demise?	Cast in Chrome	at the Frick Car and Carriage Museum takes a look at the evolution of these decorative automobile elements. What began as a means to monitor radiator temperature became a way of displaying status and personalizing vehicles. The popularity of these adornments was not lost on manufacturers, who saw an opportunity for branding, creating factory hood ornaments associated with specific makes and models.	Cast in Chrome	explores the relationship between car makes and hood ornament designs, looks at the artists who sculpted these miniature works of art, and examines their decline in popularity.	The exhibition is organized thematically, with sections devoted to the female figure, animals, mythology, art-deco-inspired motifs, and the great space race—when airplanes and rockets made their way onto hoods. Each theme is accompanied by a featured automobile marque from the 1920s or 1930s, a selection of illustrative hood ornaments, and clothing from the period. This special exhibition features the famous Spirit of Ecstasy, the well-known mascot of Rolls-Royce, represented by the Frick’s 1923 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Salamanca town car. Also included is Helen Clay Frick’s 1931 Lincoln Model K Dual Cowl Phaeton with greyhound ornament. Four additional cars will be on loan to the Frick, along with about 30 additional hood ornaments.

A Closer Look at	Cast in Chrome: The Art of Hood Ornaments
The	new exhibition at the Car and Carriage Museum	features a variety of hood ornaments—small statuettes that once graced car hoods during the golden age of the automobile. What began as a way to monitor engine temperature ultimately became a way for owners to personalize their vehicles and demonstrate their wealth. Inspired by Art Deco motifs and later the great space race, artists and car manufacturers worked together to create objects that evoked the spirit of motoring.	DeSoto Flying Goddess on the DeSoto Deluxe S-10 Sedan, 1942. Chrysler Corporation, Detroit, Michigan. Exhibited courtesy of the NB Center for American Automotive Heritage.	Elegant ladies with wind-blown hair were a common motif of hood ornaments. These flying ladies facing winds head-on found on Cadillacs and Rolls-Royces epitomized grace and beauty. Claude Johnson, managing director at Rolls-Royce in the early twentieth century, commissioned artist Charles Sykes to create an ornament for the brand after he had seen Sykes' creation "the Whisper" on Lord Montagu of Beaulieu's own Rolls-Royce. Johnson wanted an ornament that evoked the grace, sophistication, and quiet speed of the Rolls-Royce. The Spirit of Ecstasy, introduced in 1911, became a standard fitting in the early 1920s. "She has selected road travel as her supreme delight…she is expressing her keen enjoyment with her arms outstretched and her sight fixed upon the distance," said Johnson.	Spirit of Ecstasy, Rolls-Royce of America, Inc., Springfield, Massachusetts, Silver Ghost Salamanca Town Car, 1923. Ornament designed by Charles Sykes (1875-1950). Frick Art & Historical Center, 2002.1.1. Gift of William Penn Snyder III.	Animals were chosen to project speed and stamina, qualities sought after by customers. Edsel Ford selected the agile greyhound, produced by silversmithing firm Gorham Manufacturing Company, for his Lincoln models. Likewise, William Lyons, founder of the Swallow Side Car Company, chose the leaping jaguar for its quickness. Over time, the jaguar's styling changed to reflect the increasing speed of the newer models. Luxury brand Hispano-Suiza chose the stork—la cigogne—a bird known for gliding, which helps preserve its energy in flight. Explorers, conquerors, Native Americans, and gods and goddesses of Greek and Roman mythology were embodied representations of the automobile's power and strength. The Belgian car company Société Anonyme Minerva Motors selected Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, to adorn their radiator caps. In 1921, GM subsidiary Pontiac commissioned the image of the noble Chief Pontiac, an Ottawa leader, to represent the brand. Chief Pontiac personified the characteristics of the American West—perseverance and freedom. Artist William Schnell designed the Chief Pontiac hood ornaments from the mid-1920s through the 1930s. Pontiac would produce forty iterations of Chief Pontiac over thirty years.	La Cigogne (The Stork), La Hispano-Suiza Fábrica de Automóviles, c. 1920s. Ornament designed by Francois Bazin (1897-1956). Collection of Ken Merusi.	Through the 1940s, hood ornaments remained a popular automobile design element and adorned almost every car regardless of price. Those owners who wanted to flaunt their wealth and status, however, opted to attach the most glamorous, custom-made glass ornaments by artist Rene Lalique. Known for his Art Nouveau jewelry, Lalique created Art-Deco-style hood ornaments from the late 1920s through the 1930s, producing 28 commercial ornaments during the period. Coveted collector's items, Lalique ornaments were susceptible to theft in their day. These thefts were so common that Lalique commissioned the Breves Gallery in London to create pedestals for then ornaments, so that owners could remove them from their hoods when not in use and have a proper display in their homes.

An Interview with Bouke de Vries on	War & Pieces
An Interview with Bouke de Vries on	War & Pieces
January 14, 2021
Bouke de Vries on	War & Pieces
Dutch contemporary artist Bouke de Vries’s extraordinary artwork,
War & Pieces
, a spectacular 26’ long centerpiece crafted from thousands of white porcelain fragments, is currently installed at The Frick Art Museum.
De Vries derived inspiration for the installation from the sophisticated figural centerpieces that adorned the banquet tables of the European aristocracy during the 17th and 18th centuries, known as
surtout de table
. Typically displayed during the dessert course for special occasions, the figures were initially crafted from sugar, a rare and prized commodity that signaled the wealth of the host. In the 18th century, European porcelain manufactories began to produce more enduring replacements of the sugar forms. These scenes typically replicated allegorical vignettes, mythological figures, or architectural follies. The designs were imbued with symbolic value that the diners would recognize and understand; the classical, historical, and political themes referenced were intended to generate conversation among guests around the table.
De Vries references these traditions with a modern centerpiece assembled around a mushroom cloud explosion that has rendered the table a ravaged battleground. Figures clash across a heap of porcelain ruins, armed with brightly colored contemporary plastic toys—indestructible symbols of today’s waste.
De Vries (Dutch, b. 1960), who lives and works in London, began his career in fashion design before transitioning to ceramics conservation and restoration. Using his skills as a restorer, de Vries resurrects broken porcelain pieces that would otherwise be discarded and uses them to create sculptures that tackle both contemporary and historic issues. Associate Curator of Decorative Arts Dawn Reid Brean had a transatlantic chat with de Vries, who directed the installation of
War & Pieces
via video conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic, about his work.
How did your career as a conservator influence your artistic ambitions? When did you begin creating art?
For years I had looked for a more creative outlet but just couldn’t find something that felt right, not derivative. Then one day I was thinking how writers are advised to make their first book about what they know. I decided to apply that to myself, using broken ceramic objects regarded as worthless because of their damaged condition and creating new pieces with them. That way I could apply all the conservation skills and restoration techniques I had learned, developing and applying them to my art. This was a time when there was a renewed interest in ‘makers’; also, the idea of recycling was coming to the fore.
You’ve worked with the	kintsugi	technique (a Japanese ceramic tradition that uses precious-metal infused lacquer to refurbish cracked or broken pieces). Can you explain how that process relates to your practice today?
I have been familiar with
kintsugi
from my training as a conservator thirty years ago. I love the philosophy: celebrating damage as part of an object’s history rather than trying to hide it; enhancing the beauty of the damage. I have used the technique ever since and now use it in my own works. I have also played with the idea of
kintsugi
, for example, making pieces held together with gold-plated Sellotape.
How would you describe	War & Pieces	? Who is at battle here?
War & Pieces
is an installation based on the
surtout de table
of the 17th and 18th centuries. I used as a reference the grand ball given by the Duchess of Richmond on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo. Instead of a real battle, I staged it on the banqueting table, which is rather less harmful. In part it concerns the futility of war with the atomic mushroom-cloud centerpiece symbolizing total destruction. But I’m still making it beautiful, as I like such contradictions.
Do you have a favorite hidden detail in the centerpiece?
At the base there is a doll’s house sink, a reference to the English expression “everything but the kitchen sink”—well, in this installation that’s included, too.
War & Pieces has toured Europe and Asia and now North America since 2012, and it has been different at every venue. How does it feel to see different institutions interpret your work?
Fascinating—it seems to adapt itself so well to its surroundings. It looks great in an ornate setting like a formally dressed dining room, but it’s also just as good in a minimalist gallery setting.
You’ve traveled a lot for your work. What is your favorite place you have ever visited?
The next place is always the most intriguing, the next step in life’s great adventure.
When you are not creating art, what are you doing?
Not a lot, LOL. It’s so much [a] part of my life. It’s very enjoyable and it’s what I’m happiest doing. The only other thing in my life also all-consuming is my dog, Sonny.
Five words to describe your work?
Please can I have six? Creative. Iconoclastic. Ancient. Modern. Serious. Funny.

Explosion in the Green Gallery!	Bouke de Vries: War and Pieces	Comes to the Frick

Explosion in the Green Gallery!	Bouke de Vries: War and Pieces	Comes to the Frick
The Frick Art Museum's Green Gallery now features
War and Pieces
, an extraordinary artwork by contemporary artist Bouke de Vries (Dutch, b. 1960). The artist assembled thousands of white porcelain fragments to create a 24’ long installation evoking the centuries-old tradition of creating elaborate tablescapes, yet wholly contemporary in its outlook.

De Vries drew inspiration from the sophisticated figural centerpieces that adorned the banquet tables of European aristocracy during the 17th and 18th centuries, known as
surtout de table
. These elaborate figural ensembles scenes typically portrayed allegorical vignettes, mythological stories, or architectural follies. The designs were imbued with symbolic value that diners would have recognized; the classical, historical, and political themes referenced would have generated conversation among the guests around the table. Typically displayed during the dessert course for special occasions, these figures were initially crafted from sugar, a rare and prized commodity that signaled the wealth of the host. By the early 18th century, artisans at the early porcelain manufactories like Meissen and Sèvres crafted figures in porcelain. (One charming example in the Frick’s collection is the pair of
Enfants Boucher
made at Vincennes/Sèvres in the mid-18th century; they would have been part of a larger ensemble.) In fact, many of the early modelers employed at Meissen, Europe’s first porcelain manufactory, were highly-skilled confectioners, or sugar sculptors.

War and Pieces
offers a contemporary interpretation of this tradition. According to de Vries, it is a “war banquet, staging a battle royal between ancien règime sugar and revolution porcelain, referencing the 18th- and 19th-century tradition of grand banquets given on the eve of battle.” The artist read William Thackeray’s
Vanity Fair
and was struck by the scene at the Duchess of Richmond’s ball, given on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo. During the soiree, the Duke of Wellington and his generals are suddenly called away to fight Napoleon who had just crossed into Belgium.

At the center of the installation rises a mushroom cloud explosion that has rendered the table a ravaged battleground. In creating the central element, de Vries asked himself what is the most devastating act of war? The haunting, yet visually striking, images of nuclear explosions were his inspiration. The cloud is comprised of ghostly cherubs, skulls, and decapitated and disfigured porcelain dolls or “Hummels gone wrong” as de Vries refers to them. Figures of Christ on the cross and Guanyin, the ancient Chinese bodhisattva of mercy, observe the wreckage. At the top of the cloud, an angel weeps.
War and Pieces	(details).
Figures clash across heaps of porcelain ruins. The combatants include sugar-coated plaster figures of Mars and Minerva, the Roman god and goddess of war, molded from 18th century original made at a Derby porcelain factory in England. Other figures have mutated into cyborgs with bionic limbs and heads created from colorful plastic Transformers toys. These plastic elements, which de Vries calls “modern interlopers,” are indestructible symbols of today’s toxic waste. Since this is the table, and not a true battlefield, the figures wield forks, knives, and spoons. Their flags are emblazoned with two crossed knives, a reference to Meissen’s signature factory mark of crossed spears.
War and Pieces	(details).
The vignettes reference historical images of war including the iconic photograph of United States Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima and the painting
Liberty Leading the People
by Eugene Delacroix.

War and Pieces
is layered with meaning. It is at once surprising and thought-provoking. It invites the viewer on a visual exploration of a charming myriad of secreted details, but it also urges one to consider issues of mass consumption, production and waste as well as the glorification of violence in contemporary culture. The table is set with objects that reinforce de Vries’ veiled commentary on these issues. The profiles of Mars and Minerva reappear as transfer-print decoration on the neoclassical-style plates de Vries created himself. The handles of the knives and forks are in the form of Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifles and plated in gold—ostentatious symbols of luxury and brutality. Their appearance is jarring, matching the initial sensation of encountering a mushroom cloud billowing from a table in the center of the gallery.

War and Pieces
is the artist’s most ambitious work to date. De Vries created the installation in 2012 as a commissioned work for the Holburne Museum in Bath, England. It was his first large-scale project, which was initially intimidating, but ultimately pushed his artistic practice to new heights. Since 2012,
War and Pieces
has traveled around the world, customized for each venue so that it is in conversation with its interior setting. The Frick Pittsburgh is the fifteenth venue. Its installation at The Frick Art Museum in a gallery of French, Dutch, and English art from the 17th and 18th century creates an engaging dialogue between the contemporary sculpture and the depictions of aristocratic patrons and settings of the period from which it is inspired.
De Vries, who lives and works in London, began his career in fashion design before transitioning to ceramics conservation and restoration. Daily encounters with broken ceramics inspired him to create his own artworks. Using his skills as a restorer, de Vries resurrects broken porcelain pieces that would otherwise be discarded and uses them to create sculptures that tackle both contemporary and historic issues. Instead of hiding the evidence of “this most dramatic episode in the life of a ceramic object,” he gives it a new status, instills new virtues, and carries its story forward.
War and Pieces	(details).
Bouke de Vries: War and Pieces
will be on view at The Frick Art Museum through January 24, 2021. Admission is free, but timed tickets are required. Reserve your ticket to see the installation in the Frick's Permanent Collection galleries

A Lead Foot in the Gilded Age
Henry Clay Frick’s reputation as one of America’s wealthiest industrialists is well known. Frick’s wealth could afford him the nicest homes, the most lavish vacations, and the fastest cars. The last of those got him in trouble with the Pittsburgh Police Department so many times they delivered him an ultimatum that if he didn’t reduce the speed of his car to eight miles per hour he would be "hauled before a police magistrate and punished for violating a city ordinance." In 1902, the
Pittsburgh Leader
covered the controversy, calling out the "Steel-Coke King" and his "$10,000-a-year chauffeur" for speeding through Schenley Park as if it were a race track.
"Frick Must Curb Speed of His Auto."	Pittsburgh Leader	. May 29, 1902.
The car in question was the first car Mr. Frick ever purhcased, a Mercedes-Daimler flyer, nicknamed by Pittsburghers who saw it the "Dust Cloud" for the dirt it kicked up in the air. The article states that Mr. Frick wanted the fastest car in the Unites States and bought "Dust Cloud" for $15,000 in Paris. He returned with the car and his new chauffeur in question, Georges Despres, who served as the Frick Family's chauffeur from 1901 to 1920, moving with them to New York in 1905. According to Mrs. Frick's household records, Mr. Despres salary was $125 a month in 1901.

Mr. Frick thought the
speeding accusations were "ridiculous," telling a
Leader
reporter "We didn’t frighten anybody, nor did any policeman attempt to stop us…No person was in danger." While police officers were investigating the incidents of Mr. Frick’s speeding, they received a dozen complaints about the vehicle. One man said the car nearly ran him and his carriage off the road. Many automobilists at the time claimed city ordinances on speed were only for street cars, carriages, and trains, not automobiles, which were rare. The early twentieth century saw a debate over controlling the speed of automobiles as they became ever more popular and affordable, and their risks more widespread.

Helen Clay Frick and WWI

Helen Clay Frick and WWI
In 1917, when the United States entered World War I, Helen Clay Frick created a Red Cross unit and set sail for France.	Helen Clay Frick (at right) and Red Cross volunteers in Bourg-en-Bresse, France, 1918
Upon her arrival in Paris in December she went to work immediately wrapping 150,000 Christmas packages being sent to soldiers at the front. After Christmas she and the four other women in her unit began working to repatriate the huge swell of Belgian refugees located in 72 towns throughout France.
Helen Clay Frick (center; facing camera) and fellow Red Cross volunteers visiting a battlefield in France, 1918
After seven months in France, she returned to the United States. Her first-hand experiences witnessing the destruction in Europe during the war were part of the impetus for her formation of the Frick Art Reference Library in New York as a way of attempting to create photographic records of artworks and cultural treasures.
When the war ended in November 1918, Helen, still working for the Red Cross, was in charge of creating a department store/thrift shop in New York City to raise money for the benefit of wounded soldiers recovering in American Hospitals.  In contrast to typical “thrift” stores, this shop also sold expensive items, including Cartier jewelry, and even a pair of paintings commissioned from the artist George Bellows (1882–1925).
The store, called Pandora’s Box, was intended to be a short-term venture and to profit from the Christmas season. Pandora’s Box remained open about seven months and ended up raising over $50,000.

Gilded Age Children's Games
March 26, 2018
Gilded Age Gaming
Kids will be kids, but being a child in the Gilded Age was quite different than today.
Unlike the Frick children, who had their very own playhouse, most Gilded Age children played outside in the streets or fields. There were no playgrounds—children just played wherever they could find space. There were no video games or tablets either. Imagination was the best entertainment a child could hope for.  And imagination is what you needed for some of these fun Victorian era games.	Hoop and Stick	A game that sounds like what it is! Make no mistake though, this simple game was quite popular and could create fierce competition. The object of the game was to keep the hoop rolling as long as possible.	Quotis	Before Jarts threatened the lives of children everywhere, there was Quotis. This game had around nine poles or pegs and several rings. The rings were often made from rope as we hadn’t figured out how to mass produce plastic lawn games quite yet. The object of this game was to score points by tossing the rings over the pegs. Point values increased as pegs got closer to the center of the target.	Diabolo	Diabolo originated in China but became very popular in Great Britain in the 1800’s. The game is made of a wooden spool and two sticks tied together with a string. The object is to toss the spool in the air and catch it on the strings. You were sure to be the envy of your friends if you were able to perform special tricks!	Blindman's Wand	This game involved a large group of children, a blindfold and a stick—what could go wrong? The game was actually quite innocent with one child blindfolded and holding a stick called a wand. The other players took turns holding the other side of the wand while they were asked three questions. The object of the game was to guess the players based on the sound of their voice.	Ball of Wool	Ball of wool started by rolling wool into a ball and placing it in the center of the table. When the game begins, everyone starts to blow as hard as they can at the wool to prevent it from falling off their side of the table. If you fail, the group can require you to do various bizarre things as punishment. Based on what we know about Victorian dentistry, just playing this game would have been punishment enough!
