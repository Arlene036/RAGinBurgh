With each iteration, the museum creates new contexts for understanding the art of our time, connecting ever-changing publics with artists who give personal expression to the urgencies of our moment. What began as a juried show in its early years is now an ambitious curatorial initiative with aspirations beyond the museum’s walls. The International’s previous iterations have left an indelible mark not only on the museum and the communities it serves but more broadly on the history of exhibition making. With each International, the museum writes another chapter in that history, transforming our understanding of how cultural institutions create space for meaning and experience."

Andrew Carnegie conceived of an exhibition—what would become the first Carnegie International in 1896—from which the museum would collect artworks instead of enriching the museum with Carnegie’s own collection. Paintings by Winslow Homer, Camille Pissarro, Edward Hopper, and others were the seed from which this incredible collection now has grown. Since then, the museum has acquired hundreds of works of art that have appeared in the exhibition series from artists such as Doris Salcedo, Hiroshi Sugimoto, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, and many more."
