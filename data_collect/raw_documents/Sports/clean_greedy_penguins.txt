Privacy Policy
Effective date: December 22, 2022
Pittsburgh Penguins LP and its affiliates, including, but not limited to, Team Lemieux LLC, Lemieux Group LP, and WBS Hockey LP (collectively, the "Penguin Parties," "we," "us," and "our") offer you the websites, https://www.nhl.com/penguins/ and http://penguins.ice.nhl.com/, ("Websites") as well as the Official Pittsburgh Penguins mobile application ("App") and online offerings, social media pages, and any website or mobile application controlled by us and to which we link this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Services").
This Privacy Policy applies to the Services as well as to the Personal Information we receive separate from the Services (such as information related to ticket and merchandise transactions) and combine with the information we collect through the Services. Please read the following description of our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information and the rights you may have in relation to that information.
Information Collection and Use
We and our agents, representatives, and partners collect and use your Personal Information for the purposes described below.
"Personal Information" means any information that identifies a natural person.
Generally, we process Personal Information with your consent; in conformance with our legitimate business interests in maintaining the security and integrity of the Services, enforcing our legal rights, reviewing the use and performance of our websites and applications, performing quality assurance of our customer service operations, and improving and developing products and services; and to comply with legal obligations. We retain the Personal Information we collect as described below in this Privacy Policy.
Information You Submit through the Websites and Other Interactions with Us	. We collect any Personal Information you submit through the Websites and other interactions with us. For example, we collect Personal Information when you provide it to sign up for newsletters, request customer service or information, post comments, or otherwise interact with us through the Services. We also receive the Personal Information that you provide to us by mail, email, telephone, or during in-person conversations, which we may combine with other information lawfully maintained in our contact database. The Personal Information may include name, contact information, information about your family members, and the nature of the request. We use this information to complete your requests, to comply with our obligations to the National Hockey League's (NHL) requests, to provide customer service, to improve our products and services, to improve and personalize the content, marketing, and offers we provide to you, and to contact you about our products and services. The processing of your Personal Information for these purposes is based on your consent or on our legitimate interests.
Surveys	. We may invite you to participate in surveys, and we receive any information you provide when participating in those surveys. The Personal Information we may request includes name, organization name, email address, telephone number, address, birthdate, ticket account number, gender, marital status, license plate number, county of residence/employment, photographs, and/or social media usernames. We use the information to improve our products and services, to improve and personalize the content, marketing, and offers we provide to you, and to contact you about our products and services. The processing of your Personal Information for these purposes is based on your consent.
Events, Contests, Sweepstakes, and Offers.	We request Personal Information, such as your name, organization name, email address, telephone number, address, birthdate, spouse's and children's names and birthdates, ticket account number, military status, and/or social media usernames when you choose to participate in an event, contest, sweepstakes, or offer. We use this information to contact you about the event, contests, sweepstakes, and offers for which you sign up. The processing of your Personal Data for this purpose is based on your consent and our performance and your participation in the event, contest, or sweepstakes under the applicable rules, and if you do not provide the requested Personal Information, you will not be able to participate in the event, contest, or sweepstakes. We also use the information, with your consent, to improve our products and services, to improve and personalize the content, marketing, and offers we provide to you, and to contact you about our products and services.
With Our Partners.	We sometimes perform surveys, events, contests, sweepstakes, and offers in coordination with our partners. When we do so, the submission form you use to participate or to sign up for those activities will indicate the relevant partner organizations. When you submit Personal Information through the submission forms, we (the Penguin Parties) and our partners will receive the information and treat it according to our respective privacy policies. This Privacy Policy will apply to our use of the information, and we are not responsible for how our partners use the information collected from your submissions. Our partners publish their own privacy policies that apply to their data collection and use.
Information You Submit Through the App.	We have engaged a third-party vendor, YinzCam, to supply the App to you. The information collected through the App may include your name, email address, and address that you submit when you register to use the App, join the Penguins Points program, or redeem Penguins Points. We may combine the information we receive from the App with other information we have about you to develop a better understanding of your interests, so we can improve our products and services and improve and personalize the content, marketing, and offers we provide to you. The processing of your Personal Information for these purposes is based on your consent or on our legitimate interests.
Purchase and Payment Information.	We sell tickets, parking passes, merchandise, and other products and services with third-party partners. For example, we partner with NHL.com to sell merchandise online, with Aramark to sell merchandise and food and beverages at games and other locations, and with Ticketmaster to sell tickets. We receive information from these partners about your purchases, including your name, organization name, address, email address, telephone number, IP address, license plate number, payment information (as described in more detail below), and information about the products and services you purchased. We use payment information to combine the purchase information we receive from various sources with other information we have about you to improve our products and services, to improve and personalize the content, marketing, and offers we provide to you, and to contact you about our products and services. The processing of your Personal Information for these purposes is based on our legitimate interests.
Payment Card and Bank Account Information.	We may receive your payment card or bank account information when you make a purchase via website, email, mail, or telephone. We and our service providers use such payment card and bank account information to complete transactions. The processing of this Personal Information for this purpose is based on the necessity for the performance of a contract with you or on our legitimate interests. If you do not provide the information necessary to complete a purchase, you will not be able to complete a purchase. We currently work with Stripe to process payments, and Stripe's worldwide privacy policy is available at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. We also receive payment and other transaction-related information when you purchase tickets, parking passes, merchandise, and other goods and services through third parties, such as Ticketmaster or the NHL.com store, as described above. We use the payment information to combine purchase information as described above. The processing of payment information to correlate purchase information is based on our legitimate interests.
From Associated Organizations.	We may receive your name and contact information when you interact with the Penguins practice facility, or the Penguins Foundation. We may combine this information with other information we have about you to develop a better understanding of your interests, so we can improve our products and services and improve and personalize the content, marketing, and offers we provide to you.
From Other Sources.	To improve our products and services and to improve and personalize the content, marketing, and offers we provide to you, we work with third parties to obtain relevant information about you and your online activities, such as demographic, occupation, education, lifestyle, and social media information. We combine this information with the Personal Information we have about you. The processing of this information for these purposes is based on our legitimate interests.
Marketing and Other Informational Updates.	With your consent and as otherwise permitted by law, we combine and use Personal Information and other information we receive from and about you to contact you with information from us about our products and services, our partners' products and services, and to notify you periodically about important changes to the Services (such as material changes to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach). You may withdraw your consent at any time to marketing messages by unsubscribing from them. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the withdrawal. In addition, withdrawing consent from marketing communications does not affect our ability to send you other communications, such as those related to providing services to you or responding to your requests.
The processing of your Personal Information for this purpose is based on your consent or on our legitimate interests. You may opt-out from receiving marketing-related communications by either clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of marketing-related emails we send you or by selecting your preferences	here	. We will process opt-out requests without undue delay.
Automatic Usage Data Collection through Cookies and Similar Technologies.	When you use the Services (e.g., access or use video highlights, video offerings, or chat rooms and bulletin boards, or participate in other events, promotions, and interactive online activities) or open our emails, we and the NHL, advertising networks, social media widgets, and analytics providers collect certain information, including Personal Information, by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs. The information collected in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device IDs and characteristics, operating system version, language preferences, demographic information, information about preferences and interests (e.g., your favorite Pittsburgh Penguins players), search queries, date and time of your access to the Services, referring URLs, and information about the usage of our Services. We use this information to assess user behavior and the amount of traffic to various parts of our Services, to provide you with personalized content and advertising on and off the Services and through email, and to prevent fraud. We also provide this information on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our marketing partners and/or to advertisers. For more information about third party cookies, read our	Cookie Policy	below.
We link this data with other information we have collected from and about you. Our service partners may also collect and combine information collected on our Services and emails with other information about your activities over time, on other devices, and on other websites or applications if those websites and applications also use the same service partners. Our service partners use the information they collect according to their privacy policies. Like most websites, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain website usage data for the above purposes. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt-out, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Please note that this website is part of NHL.com, and the NHL and its partners may collect or permit others to collect information on this website, over which we have no control.	This Privacy Policy does not cover or describe their use of cookies and similar technology to collect information from and about you. You may prevent cookie and other automatic data collection by changing browser settings to block and delete cookies when you access the Services through a web browser. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly. The Services do not respond to browser do-not-track signals. Learn more about our online advertising practices in the Online Advertising section below.
The processing of your Personal Information for these purposes is based on your consent and on our legitimate interests.
Online Advertising.	We use industry standard website tracking and delivery technology to show you advertising on the Services and other websites and online services about our products and services tailored to your individual interests based on information we receive from and about you through your use of the Services, other interactions with us, and from third parties. We use ad networks to target our advertising to users through the use of click-stream, demographic, behavioral, and contextual information. The third-party ad networks and advertisers on the Services collect and use this information subject to their own privacy policies.
You may opt-out of receiving personalized advertisements on this browser or device from advertisers or other advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out options of each of those organizations. Links to those websites are here:
Network Advertising Initiative: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/	Digital Advertising Alliance: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
The processing of your Personal Information for this purpose is based on your consent or on legitimate interest grounds.
Legal and Similar Disclosures	. We will access, preserve, and disclose your information to the extent we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; respond to your requests; comply with the law; enforce our Terms and Conditions; or protect your, our, or others' rights, property, or safety.
Anonymization.	In some situations, we e anonymize the information collected through the Services and use and disclose it for business purposes, including improving our marketing and promotional efforts, analyzing usage and downloads, improving our content and product offerings, and generally improving the Services and better tailoring them to meet our visitors' needs, in which case, such information is not considered Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
Information Sharing
We do not disclose Personal Information about you except as described in this Privacy Policy. We do not rent or sell your Personal Information, although we share Personal Information with partners so they can send you marketing offers and we permit online advertisers to collect and use your Personal Information as set forth above.
Sharing with NHL Parties
We may share ticketing and other information about you with other members of the National Hockey League family ("NHL Family"). For example, we may share ticketing and other information about you with the National Hockey League and NHL Interactive CyberEnterprises, LLC, including so that they can conduct analysis to better understand NHL fans and fan engagement across the NHL Family, including its member clubs. NHL Family may also use and share insights to enable the NHL, including its member clubs, to customize and improve their services, advertising and communications.
Third Party Service Providers and Vendors.	We share the Personal Information we collect with our service providers and vendors so they can provide their services to us. For example, we share information with certain vendors to complete requests from website forms, to fulfill, customize, and deliver products and orders, to send postal mail, email, and text messages, to perform data analytics, to provide marketing assistance, to detect fraudulent orders, to process credit card payments, to collect on delinquent accounts, and to provide customer service. Our policy is to only provide your Personal Information to such agents for the purposes of providing their services to us. However, certain third parties, such as payment gateways, payment transaction processors, and ad networks have their own privacy policies with respect to the information they receive. For these vendors, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which they will handle your Personal Information.
To Complete Requests.	We will disclose information to third parties to complete your requests. For example, we share Personal Information with third parties who coordinate events, manage youth hockey, and operate the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation in order to respond to your requests.
Internally Among Penguin Parties.	We disclose the Personal Information we collect from and about you among the Penguin Parties (including our affiliates and subsidiaries) to fulfill obligations to you and to operate the Services consistent with the Privacy Policy and applicable law.
Social Media Networks and Users.	You may choose to share or publish information about your activity on the Services with other websites and online services, including social media. When you do this, we will share the requested information as well as associated information, including technical information about your activity on the Services.
Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.	To the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, securitization, insuring, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be disclosed in connection with the negotiation of such transaction, and/or sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.
With Your Permission.	We may also disclose your information with your permission.
Where Information is Processed
The information that we collect through the Services will be transferred to and processed in the United States for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We also may subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise share your data with, third parties in the United States or countries other than your country of residence.
The data protection laws in these countries may be different from, and less stringent than, those in your country of residence. We have appropriate measures in place to protect your Personal Information, such as internal obligations to comply with the EU Standard Contractual Clauses when we receive Personal Information from individuals in the EU. You may contact us at	[email¬†protected]	to request a copy of the safeguards we have in place.
Links to Third Parties
The Services contain links to websites and other online services, such as NHL.com, Ticketmaster.com, and others, that are not operated by the Penguin Parties. These third parties may collect information about you through the use of their own cookies and web beacons, may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party websites and mobile apps, and we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on each website or mobile application that you use.
Security
We maintain appropriate and reasonable organizational and technical measures for the protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Personal Information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion. However, no security program can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. If we learn of a security breach, we will comply with all applicable law to notify you about the breach so that you can take protective steps.
Retention of Information
We consider several factors to determine how long we keep Personal Information. We consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Once we no longer have a need for your Personal Information, we will securely destroy it in accordance with our standards and applicable laws and regulations.
Information Accuracy and Your Rights
While we take various steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your Personal Information, we rely upon you to provide accurate and complete Personal Information when interacting with us. You may request access and amendment to the Personal Information we have about you. We will take steps to respond to your request. In some limited circumstances, we may not be able to grant you access to your information, for example, if doing so would threaten the security or privacy of another individual.
All persons in the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation whose Personal Information is processed by the Penguin Parties have the legal right to request: (i) access, (ii) rectification (iii) erasure, (iv) restriction of processing, (v) object to processing, and/or (vi) data portability of their Personal Information. Any such requests should be submitted to	[email¬†protected]	.
If you are in the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU supervisory authority. However, if you have a complaint regarding the processing of your Personal Information, we kindly request that you first contact us directly as indicated in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy, and we will reply promptly.
Your California Privacy Rights
California law allows California residents who have provided their personal information to us to request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information (if any) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared such information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to	[email¬†protected]	.
Children's Privacy
The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under the age of 13. We recommend that persons over 13 but under 18 years of age ask their parents for permission before using the Services or sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
From time to time, we may offer children the opportunity to enter promotions or contests via the Services. In those cases, our collection of the children's information will be limited for the purposes of administering the promotions or contests. Our policy is to only collect children's information when we have verifiable parental consent or are otherwise permitted by law. All questions about our policies related to children's personal information and our personal information sharing practices should be directed to	[email¬†protected]	.
Enforcement
If you submit an inquiry or complaint to us, we will contact you regarding your concerns. When necessary, we will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the handling of Personal Information that cannot be resolved between you and the Penguin Parties.
Changes to Privacy Policy
Without prejudice to your rights under applicable law, the Penguin Parties reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. We will make the revised policy accessible through the Services, so you should review the policy periodically to ensure your familiarity with its terms. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, you will be provided with appropriate notice, and we will seek your consent to the updated policy in accordance with legal requirements. If you do not agree to the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should request deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at	[email¬†protected]	.
Miscellaneous
None of NHL ICE, NHL Enterprises, L.P., NHL Enterprises Canada, L.P., NHL Enterprises B.V., the National Hockey League and its other member clubs, nor any of their respective officers, directors, governors, owners, other officials, partners, partnerships, principals, employees, affiliates and other related entities, servants, agents, representatives, successors and assigns, have any control of, or responsibility or liability for, the Penguin Parties' use, disclosure, storage or transmission of any information the Penguin Parties collect through the Services.

Game dates, times, opponents and promotions subject to change.

In addition to enhanced protective measures and	contactless features	throughout the building, please note the following policies in effect for Pittsburgh Penguins hockey games.
For the health and safety of our fans, staff, and players, it is important we all do our part. Please do not attend if you are feeling ill.	Be sure to download the Penguins App to access your mobile tickets.
1. Mobile Ticketing
PPG Paints Arena is a mobile-only facility. For game entry, a mobile ticket must be displayed on a smartphone. Ticket buyers and fans that received forwarded tickets can access their tickets by visiting	www.pittsburghpenguins.com/myaccount	or the Penguins app. If tickets were purchased through	ticketmaster.com	, we encourage you to download the Ticketmaster app.
All mobile tickets will feature a rotating barcode. As a result,	camera screenshots or paper printouts will not work	. If you place your digital ticket in your Apple wallet, no barcode will be visible - however, the scanners will detect it! If you do not have a mobile ticket for entry, you will be directed to the DICK'S Sporting Goods Box Office inside the Highmark Gate for assistance.
View Mobile Ticketing Procedures
2. All Bags are Prohibited
No bags will be permitted in PPG Paints Arena. Exceptions, after inspection, will be made for:
Medical Bags	Diaper Bags	Wristlets or Wallets (no larger than 4" x 6" x 1.5")
If carrying an item that requires screening, please be sure to enter the designated door at each gate.
3. Cashless Transactions	PPG Paints Arena is now a cashless venue. Credit and debit cards as well as Apple/Google Pay are accepted. A reverse ATM will be available to convert cash to a pre-paid Visa card. This service is free of charge to fans. Cards can be used anywhere, not just PPG Paints Arena. Cards have no expiration date. Any amount from $1-500 can be put on the cards. It is possible to verify the card balance. Reverse ATMs can be found in the following locations: Highmark Lobby, F.N.B. Club, Captain Morgan Club, Sections 106, 119, 206 and 234.
4. Official NHL Fan Code of Conduct Policy
The National Hockey League and its Member Clubs are committed to creating a safe and comfortable environment and enjoyable entertainment experience. NHL fans have a right to expect an environment in which they will be treated in a consistent, professional and courteous manner by all arena, team and National Hockey League personnel. The Players and Officials have the same rights. See full	Fan Code of Conduct
5. Hockey Etiquette
As a show of hockey etiquette, and as a courtesy to others, we ask that you wait until there is a stoppage of play before leaving or returning to your seat. Also, please refrain from leaning forward, as it may obstruct the view of others seated behind you.	For the comfort and safety of your fellow fans, please keep aisles clear. Standing behind the last row of seats is prohibited unless designated by a Standing Room Only ticket.
For additional game day information, please visit PPG Paints Arena's	FAQ	and	A to Z Guide	or call	412.642.1800	during normal business hours (Monday-Friday, 8:30 AM-5:00 PM).

The Penguins and PPG are working together on a series of stories to feature the most colorful fans.
Penguins Fans from Down Under Fall in Love Over Hockey
Many newlyweds center their honeymoon trips around the beach. But for Kyle and Katrina Batty of Melbourne, Australia, they centered theirs around their shared love of the Pittsburgh Penguins.	After it was announced the Penguins would be playing in the 2023 Winter Classic at Fenway Park, the newlyweds knew they had to be there for it.	‚ÄúI saw it after I woke up one morning and was like, ‚Äòthis is our honeymoon,‚Äô‚Äù Kyle said.
Gram Zammers Bring New Life to Penguins Games
Cindy Falls and Debbie Vallor have lived in Pittsburgh their entire lives, with a second home at PPG Paints Arena. The two can be seen at countless home games for the Penguins, and one night, Cindy donned a shirt given to her by Debbie that said, ‚ÄúNever underestimate an old woman who loves hockey.‚Äù	That quickly caught the eye of Erin Exley, Vice President of Ticket Marketing and Operations for the Penguins, who was looking for fans to fill the Gram Zam, a new fan initiative for this season.
Penguins Fan Turns Crosby Jersey into NFL-Inspired Puffer Jacket

Science of Hockey School Assembly Program Introduces Elementary & Middle School Students to Science through Hockey
Published on	June 25, 2021
.entry-meta
.entry-header
By Cindy Himes
On June 24, the Penguins Foundation staff was treated to a preview of	Science of Hockey	, the amazing new school assembly program from the Carnegie Science Center that was created in partnership with PPG and the Pens Foundation ‚Äì and it truly was amazing!
The 45-minute program is geared toward students in grades K-8 and includes several live demonstrations led by a Science on the Road educator.¬† Penguins Director of Youth Hockey Shannon Webster and team mascot Iceburgh both appear in pre-recorded video segments demonstrating how science and the sport of hockey intersect.
Students have the opportunity to learn about physics, geometry, physiology and materials science using the sport of hockey as examples.¬† The goal is to excite students with engaging demonstrations that includes a swinging bowling ball pendulum (forces of motion) and a submerged 3D-printed model of the Stanley Cup in liquid nitrogen (cryogenic chemistry).
The Science of Hockey program is the latest school assembly show from Carnegie Science Center‚Äôs Science on the Road outreach initiative.¬† Schools, libraries and organizations can now book Science of Hockey as a virtual program or bring the assembly to their location this fall.
Whether it‚Äôs understanding Newton‚Äôs laws of motion or Bernoulli‚Äôs principle of lift, the show will capture young students‚Äô curiosity and hopefully develop an understanding of the many forces behind science.
For more information on booking this innovative Science of Hockey program, visit	CarnegieScienceCenter.org/SOR	.

Technology in Education
<h3 class="program-overview__title u-text-center">Program Overview</h3>	To bring technology into the classroom in order to even the playing field for all students, no matter their economic background.
Technology in Education	Technology in Education connects all of our technology based education programs.
Tablets in Education, introduced during the 2013-14 school year, shares Kindle Fire tablets with area schools and special needs programs.	In the first year of the program, the Foundation donated 1,500 Kindle Fire tablets to over 60 schools and special needs programs in Allegheny County. We extended the program to reach even more school districts in Allegheny County and expanded to include 11 surrounding counties and their Intermediate Units.
3,900	Kindles have been provided to over 60 schools and special needs programs in Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Mercer, Westmoreland and Washington Counties.
The devices are designed to be utilized for unique educational programs, extended learning programs and programs for children with disabilities. The technology utilized in Tablets in Education is designed to enhance a child‚Äôs academic achievement while continuing to support their social development and relationships with adults and peers through the most critical years of an adolescent‚Äôs growth and development.
42 school districts in Allegheny County have participated in the STEAM Lending Library	In 2015, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation teamed up with the Allegheny Intermediate Unit 3 (AIU3) to create a first of its kind, STEAM Lending Library. This program allows school districts in Allegheny County to borrow the latest in educational technology to expose their students to STEAM Learning. After teachers attend learning sessions at the AIU3, they are permitted to borrow this technology. 
With help from an awarded PA Smart Grant, the Pens Foundation expanded their STEAM Lending Library initiative to 22 counties spanning Western PA to provide students with access to technological education to engage even more students within the region to STEAM education. This program has impacted over 400,000 students grade K-12, which has allowed the Penguins Foundation to strengthen its mission of stressing the value of education.
35 School Districts in Bedford, Blair, Cambria, and Somerset counties have participated in the STEM Lending Center	In 2018, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation with a grant provided by UPMC,  continues to support its mission of ‚Äústressing the value of education‚Äù by providing the latest, high-tech educational devices to expand the STEM Lending Center of Appalachia Intermediate Unit 8 (AIU8). This initiative will allow students from the 35 school districts and non-public schools located within the Bedford, Blair, Cambria and Somerset counties access to STEM Learning, impacting nearly 50,000 students.
77 +	School districts in 5 counties will benefit from the Foundation's STEAM/STEM initiatives.
The STEAM Lending Library (AIU3) and STEM Lending Center (AIU8) l feature high-tech devices and teaching tools for teachers to use in their classrooms. This program allows teachers to attend professional development sessions at the AIU3 and the AIU8 and to sign out the different pieces of equipment to use with their students. This program ultimately allows districts the ability to expose their students to technology without being financially responsible for supplying the technology.
1,500 +	Individual items contained in the STEAM Lending Library and the STEM Lending Center
By providing these counties with the opportunity to use the latest in STEAM/STEM technology, we are continuing to "even the playing field" for all schools and students.
225,000 + Hours of Learning	Since 2014, over 87,000 students have participated in the Pittsburgh Penguins Future Goals - Hockey Scholar program. Hockey Scholar is a unique science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) online resource for students in grades 4-8. This online course leverages the exciting game of hockey as a learning vehicle to energize students in these critical topic areas and is available to schools at no cost.

Break the Ice | Hockey Talks
<h3 class="program-overview__title u-text-center">Program Overview</h3>	Hockey Talks is a program that was inspired by Rick Rypien, former Vancouver Canucks forward, who tragically lost his battle with mental health issues in 2011. Today, clubs across the NHL participate, sharing resources, stories and breaking the stigma that so often surrounds mental health. The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation proudly became a part of Hockey Talks through our Break the Ice initiative in 2020 with the support of Citrone 33.
Break the Ice	Created by Citrone 33 and the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation, Break the Ice is a movement in support of Hockey Talks for each and every Penguins fan, as mental health is health. Through #BreakTheIce, fans are challenged to connect with one another and to take positive action regarding their own mental wellness and that of their loved ones. Last season's Hockey Talks Game was on January 11, 2024; plus, we proudly work year-round to show that Pittsburgh is a city that champions mental wellness with our Break the Ice campaign.
Penguins Bandana
At the April 14 Penguins game during the 2021.22 season, fans received a Penguins Hockey Talks Bandana courtesy of Citrone 33. Designed in collaboration with Shop Steel City, the Penguins Bandana encourages fans to visit BeThereCertificate.org to learn how to maintain your own mental health, recognize when someone is struggling and safely support them. The Be There Certificate is an online course created by Jack.org in partnership with Born This Way Foundation. It is open to all fans and supporters... even if you were unable to attend our Hockey Talks game this season.	Complete the Be There Certificate
Pittsburgh Penguins	The Pittsburgh Penguins players proudly support our mental health efforts through Hockey Talks and Break the Ice.  Each season, the team wears Hockey Talks decals on their helmets for the dedicated game and also joins in the conversation about mental wellness to help end the stigma.  Starting in 2021.22, the players used green tape on their sticks for pre-game warm-ups to further raise awareness - a new tradition that has continued.
#BreakTheIce Card
Fans may share how you break the ice by downloading our 'I #BreakTheIce By' Card found here.  We encourage you to post your completed card on social media using #BreakTheIce and #HockeyTalks.	Download Your #BreakTheIce Card
Be an Icebreaker
Talking about mental health should be year-round and not just on our dedicated Break the Ice Game. Start the conversation about mental health today by checking in with yourself, your loved ones and your neighbors.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat have I done today to improve my mental strength?‚Äù  When you start the conversation, you help to build a mentally strong and stigma-free community.	Here are suggested questions to help break the ice with those you care about:	"How are you feeling today?"	"How do you prioritize your mental health?"	"Did you take a moment today to check-in with yourself on your mental wellness?"	"What is one way, starting today, that you can focus on your mental health?"
#BreakTheIce Wristbands	Starting in 2020, #BreakTheIce EMBRACE-lets provided an opportunity for fans to check-in with their loved ones on their mental wellness. These complimentary wristband sets were available courtesy of EMBRACE Pittsburgh to help end the stigma associated with mental health. If you may have an EMBRACE-let, be sure to share a photo on social media noting how you #BreakTheIce.

Our Programs	/	Ronald McDonald House Care Mobile
Ronald McDonald House Care Mobile
<h3 class="program-overview__title u-text-center">Program Overview</h3>	In October 2019, the Penguins Foundation unveiled a new Care Mobile in partnership with Ronald McDonald House Charities of Pittsburgh and Morgantown and UPMC Children‚Äôs Hospital of Pittsburgh.  The 40-foot vehicle features a Penguins-themed distraction therapy treatment room and provides over a dozen different services and tests -- including wellness visits, immunizations, physicals, sick visits and more -- to children in underserved communities in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
Distraction Therapy	Unique to the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile is the Distraction Therapy Program. This program alleviates the stress children experience when going to the doctor‚Äôs office. When children enter the exam rooms, they are transported into a Penguins-themed igloo or to an under the sea adventure. The children then focus on what is going on around them rather than the reason they are there. Games have even been designed for these rooms during the medical visit, thus making it a better experience for both the parents and the children.
Services	Services provided by the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile include:  wellness visits, immunizations, sports physicals, dental exams, asthma care, and sick visits.
Love Your Melon	Did you know? Thanks to the tremendous support of Penguins fans, the Care Mobile was heavily funded by the Penguins Foundation‚Äôs Love Your Melon knit beanies with an overall contribution of $200,000 to the vehicle!
More Information	For more information about the Care Mobile, please call 412-692-7777 or click below	Click Here for More Information	btn-row
Testimonials	‚ÄúWithout the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, so many kids wouldn‚Äôt be able to get the care they need. We are able to give required and important vaccinations to children who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be able to attend school. We are also able to do driver‚Äôs license physicals, which can be very difficult for patients to obtain due to lack of transportation and medical insurance. The Ronald McDonald Care Mobile really helps break barriers for patients to improve both their physical and mental health, in addition to their quality of life.‚Äù	Alexis Myers, UPMC Children‚Äôs Hospital of Pittsburgh Certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, Pediatric Primary Care Mental Health Specialist, and Ronald McDonald Care Mobile Team Member
Testimonials
‚ÄúThe Ronald McDonald Care Mobile has been a great asset to our School District. The entire staff always comes with a positive and professional attitude. They provide high quality care and are willing to work in conjunction with our staff in all aspects of medical care.

Our Programs	/	COOL Zone
COOL Zone
<h3 class="program-overview__title u-text-center">Program Overview</h3>	Shaped like an "igloo," the COOL Zone is an early intervention behavioral health evaluation program for kids ages 3 through 12.  Since 2015, the COOL Zone has provided mental health services to 650+ children across all area COOL Zone locations.
What is COOL?	Children Overcoming Obstacles & Limits (COOL)
The Children Overcoming Obstacles and Limits (COOL) Zone was developed, with the support of the Penguins Foundation, by the Matilda Theiss Early Childhood Behavioral Health Program, part of UPMC Western Behavioral Health.  Shaped like an ‚Äúigloo‚Äù to provide a safe space for children, the COOL Zone is a behavioral health program for young children who exhibit symptoms of or who currently have behavioral health diagnosis. This program increases accessibility to high quality mental health services by partnering with existing schools and child-oriented settings within Allegheny County.  Within these child friendly settings, the Penguins COOL Zone serves children experiencing a range of behavioral and emotional disruptions such as: aggression, anxiety, depression, withdrawal, family disruption, emotional difficulties, traumatic responses, and more.
It is through play that children‚Äôs behaviors are learned and tested.  It is also through play that children‚Äôs emotions and stressors are communicated.  The COOL Zone allows for therapy to feel safe for children and allows them to communicate in a way they understand ‚Äì through play. Therapists provide child-focused, individualized, encouraging and specialized play therapy to help support a child‚Äôs most pressing concerns and needs. The COOL Zone utilizes interventions that are natural for children to comfortably make progress in their therapy.
8	Number of COOL Zone igloos in the Pittsburgh region.
First piloted at Edgewood Primary in the Woodland Hills School District in 2015, the COOL Zone program is currently within 8 locations in Western Pennsylvania.  These locations are: Wilkins Primary School, Twin Rivers Primary and Intermediate School, Penn Hills Elementary School, Francis McClure Elementary School, Hosanna House, UPMC Pine Center, UPMC Western Behavioral Health of the Alleghenies in Altoona & UPMC Western Behavioral Health in the SouthSide.
The COOL Zone includes not only the igloo, but also a child-friendly classroom space with colorful wall art and toys to help children communicate in therapy in a safe and age-appropriate way.   Each program room is equipped with the latest activities and centers that support each child‚Äôs mental health needs. These include: sensory items, calming areas, group activity corners, social-emotional games and projects as well as private areas for individual therapy and support.
1 Goal	To Help Children & Families Grow & Heal
The therapeutic programs offered through the COOL Zone are tailored in order to meet the special needs of each individual child.  The ultimate goal is to make sure that children and their families have the foundation to grow and heal.   After successfully participating in the program, children have less behavioral concerns, more positive behavior, reduced symptoms of trauma and stress, and improved and strengthened relationships between the children and their families, caregivers, and other children.
Matilda Theiss Early Childhood Behavioral Health is the cornerstone of early childhood mental health services at UPMC Western Behavioral Health and offers a variety of vital programs to promote the health and well-being of pediatric clients and their families.
EMBRACE Pittsburgh	Funded by Citrone 33
EMBRACE Pittsburgh, funded by Citrone 33, is a proud supporter of the COOL Zone program. Thanks to their assistance, the Penguins Foundation is committed to build 10 total igloos in the region in the very near future.

Testimonials
‚ÄúThe Igloo is like a secret cove. It helps kids open up a lot because they don‚Äôt feel like everyone‚Äôs watching. Other kids who aren‚Äôt in the program walk by and say, ‚ÄòI want to go to the COOL Zone!‚Äô‚Äù
Carolyn Passen, Clinician	COOL Zone
Testimonials
‚ÄúChildren have potential to flourish given the right environment and support. The COOL Zone allows for children to interact with specialized child therapists in a safe and friendly environment. The most important aspect of the COOL Zone is that it doesn‚Äôt feel like therapy and there isn‚Äôt the stigma associated with ‚Äúmental health‚Äù for children for their families. Children feel comfortable and safe opening up in the COOL Zone. That is how healing begins.‚Äù

Time for Your Mind	Local students and teachers are currently participating in our pilot phase of MindHacks!  Following the conclusion of the pilot, our goal is to bring MindHacks to middle school students throughout Western Pennsylvania.
MindHacks Videos	The MindHacks video series, produced by PensTV and funded by the Citrone 33 Foundation, consists of short-form ‚ÄúMindHack‚Äù videos that feature thoughtful (and fun!) coping skills through the eyes of professional athletes from Pittsburgh‚Äôs sports teams and beyond. These ambassadors and role models discuss emotional conditions, practical tips to address them, and their favorite coping methods.
The Toolkit	In addition to the MindHacks video series, the toolkit also includes educational items for hands-on learning, as well as Penguins-branded items to excite students to engage in mindful practices. The accompanying curriculum utilizes various teaching techniques, including group discussion, games, team-building activities, and practice of relaxation skills. The program maintains a close alignment with the PA Department of Education‚Äôs Career Ready Skills Continuum.

About Little Penguins
remove	add	What is the Little Penguins Learn to Play Program?
The Learn to Play initiative aims to be the gold standard for youth hockey programs with the goal of inspiring more families to join the hockey community. Learn to Play changes the way youth hockey is offered by providing an all-inclusive program for first-time participants: ¬†head-to-toe equipment, eight (8) to ten (10) weeks of age appropriate on-ice instruction, and certified coaching in a fun and safe atmosphere.
remove	add	How much does the Little Penguins Learn to Play Program cost?
The participation fee varies by facility, but ranges between $249 and $299, plus processing fees.
remove	add	What are the eligibility requirements for the Little Penguins Learn to Play Program?
The Little Penguins Learn to Play program is offered to new, first-time participants (boys and girls), between the ages of five (5) and nine (9). First-time participants are those who have not been previously participated in a hockey league/program (house/rec league, learn to play, mini-mites, camps, etc.) or registered with USA Hockey. It is strongly recommended that participants complete a Learn to Skate session at their local ice rink prior to enrolling in Little Penguins.	*If the host facility becomes aware that a registered child has previous hockey league/program experience, the child will be removed from the Little Penguins program and the parent/guardian(s) will not be refunded.
remove	add	Does my child need to know how to skate before they sign up for Little Penguins?
It is	strongly	recommended that children complete a "Learn to Skate" class through their local ice rink prior to enrolling in Little Penguins. In addition, most rinks have regular public ice skating sessions which are a great way to gain experience and confidence on the ice. For those looking to register for a "Learn to Skate" program, please contact your local ice rink.
remove	add	Where will Little Penguins Learn to Play be offered?
The Little Penguins Learn to Play program is offered at over twenty local ice rinks throughout the Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio and West Virginia region.

A list of all our host locations, can be found below ‚ÄúOpen Registrations‚Äù in the "Rink and Address Locations" section.
Registration
remove	add	I registered my child for the Little Penguins program, but my child is no longer able to participate. Can I cancel the registration?
We understand that things change and ask that you contact us as soon as possible with any refund requests. Please understand the Little Penguins Learn to Play program cannot offer refunds for participants that: do not meet the program eligibility requirements; register for multiple locations/sessions; or cancel after the registrant‚Äôs equipment is kitted and/or picked up. This policy is in place because once registration fees are collected, preparations for an individuals participation begin quickly by the Penguins as well as host sites to kit equipment, plan ice time/coaches and other fixed costs. All of which are expenses that cannot be recouped if a registrant cancels in the above instances. We care about your customer experience and will work to accommodate each request individually. Please email	[email¬†protected]	with any cancellation questions.
remove	add	I want to register my child at our local rink, but the Little Penguins sessions are full. What do I do?

remove	add	I have two children. Will they be in the same session?
If you successfully registered your children for the same session, then yes. All participants will be on the ice at the same time. Coaches may split the class into groups for drills throughout the program.
remove	add	What is USA Hockey and why is my child registered with them?
USA Hockey is the national governing body of ice hockey in the United States (	https://www.usahockey.com/	). USA Hockey provides a number of resources for the Learn to Play program, including; age-appropriate training modules and practice plans, coaching certification, background screening and insurance for all Learn to Play participants. Each Little Penguins participant receives a free USA Hockey player membership for the season in which they complete the program.

Upon registration, each participant will receive head-to-toe equipment. The equipment provided includes: a helmet (with a cage), neck guard, shoulder pads, elbow pads, gloves, hockey pants, shin guards, skates, jersey, hockey socks, a hockey stick and an equipment bag.

Participants keep the equipment upon graduating from the Little Penguins program.
Next Steps/Continue to Play

Current Player Initiatives
<h3 class="program-overview__title u-text-center">Program Overview</h3>	Each season, the Pittsburgh Penguins players join the Penguins Foundation to be champions of our local youth through the power of hockey.  Here are a few recent initiatives by the Pens that have positively impacted kids in our community.
Penguins for a Day	Each season, children from the Make-A-Wish Foundation are signed to honorary one-day contracts making them official Pittsburgh Penguins for the day. These new team members are geared up in their very own custom Pens jerseys prior to hitting the ice for a full day of memories with their hockey heroes.
Project Bundle-Up	When autumn leaves fall, it marks the time of year for the Penguins Project Bundle-Up Shopping Day in partnership with the Salvation Army and DICK'S Sporting Goods. After a team practice, Penguins players spend an afternoon shopping with children in need of outerwear for the cold winter months. The children depart with new coats, boots, hats, gloves and scarves - along with autographs from their favorite Pens players.
Children‚Äôs Hospital Visit	A Christmas tradition that began in the early 1980s, the annual Penguins Children‚Äôs Hospital Visit is truly an incredible and spirited event.  During the visit, each player shares the joy of the holidays with the kids staying at UPMC Children‚Äôs Hospital of Pittsburgh by stopping by each child‚Äôs room and providing special gifts selected by the team.
Rainbow Kitchen Meal Serve	American born players annually visit the Rainbow Kitchen to serve a Thanksgiving meal leading into the holiday season. The Penguins players are proud to assist Rainbow Kitchen, which provides a vital safety net for hungry children, struggling families, low-income elderly, disabled individuals and local residents who are homeless or unemployed.
Crosby's Charity Suite	Sidney Crosby welcomes children from local charities to his personal suite to enjoy Penguins home games.  These special gameday guests are treated to an in-game welcome announcement, visit from Iceburgh and a gift from Sid as a memento to remember the game.
Rust's Seats for Strength	Through Seats for Strength, Bryan Rust welcomes children to each home game with VIP tickets and a post-game meet-and-greet.  In recent seasons, he has supported local kids from Allegheny Family Network and UPMC Western Behavioral Health's COOL Zone program.  This season's Seats for Strength partner organization is Friends Who Stutter, commonly known as FRIENDS.  These little superstars share their strength with Bryan each game during an exciting evening of Pens hockey.
Malkin's "I'm Score for Kids"	Evgeni Malkin's "I'm Score for Kids" initiative launched at the start of the 2022.23 season to benefit the Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) of Pittsburgh and Morgantown. Evgeni, who wears No. 71, has pledged to donate $710 per each of his regular-season points. During the 2023.24 season and with 67 points, Malkin‚Äôs donation to RMHC is $47,570. Local McDonald's restaurants have matched Malkin's donation, increasing the total donation this season to RMHC to $95,140.
Malkin and local McDonald‚Äôs restaurants have donated a grand total of $213,000 to the RMHC of Pittsburgh and Morgantown over the past two seasons.

Outstanding Pittsburgh Penguins Ornaments
When it comes to showing team pride, few can compare to fans of the Pittsburgh Penguins. Fortunately, Wendell August Forge gives you many ways to display your support, from ornaments, plaques and t-shirts to coasters, serving trays and jewelry.	The latest addition to our amazing assortment of Penguins items is our 2020 Collector's ornament, die-cut by hand and available in aluminum or bronze. Its artwork features the official Penguins logo incorporated in a sophisticated snowflake design. Because this 2020 Pittsburgh Penguin ornament is the very first in a 10-year series, now is the time to start your complete collection.	Check out our other hand-forged Penguins ornaments, too, like the	Let's Go Pens 2019 Collector's Ornament	or the	Limited Edition Pittsburgh Penguins Collector's Ornament	. Both of these pieces in bronze are accented with gorgeous Swarovski crystals. Hand-forged by our expert artisans at Wendell August Forge, all our ornaments reflect our dedication to superior craftsmanship and the power of tradition, just like the winning tradition of Pittsburgh's five-time Stanley Cup champions.
Practical Memorabilia with an Added Benefit
Pittsburgh Penguin keepsakes can be practical, too. Consider upgrading your entertainment style with the	Penguins Logo Patterned Chip and Dip	server, the	Pittsburgh Penguins Blades of Champions Cutting Board and Knife Set	or the	Penguins Civic Arena Roof Pilsner Four-Piece Limited Edition set	. By the way, all items with Civic Arena in their name are made from a piece of the original Civic Arena roof, home to the Penguins from 1967 to 2010. With these special mementos comes a true piece of Penguins history.	One other fabulous thing about purchasing Pittsburgh Penguins memorabilia is that both you and the Pittsburgh community benefit. A portion of the proceeds from most of these items goes toward The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation, committed to assisting Pittsburgh citizens in need, particularly children.	In short, there's everything to feel good about when you get Wendell August Forge Pittsburgh Penguins gifts and keepsakes: you're showing your team dedication, enjoying superbly handcrafted items, plus benefiting a great cause. It all adds up to a victory for everyone.

HOW MAY WE ASSIST YOUR MISSION?
<h3 class="program-overview__title u-text-center">Program Overview</h3>
At the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation, we believe that being a good citizen is just as important as the work we do on and off the ice. Each season, the Foundation supports local charities in a number of ways. How can we assist your organization and your goals?	Hockey is for Everyone!
In-Kind Donation Requests	Are you holding a fundraiser? We may be able to help!
Organizations must meet the following criteria to qualify for an in-kind donation:	‚Ä¢	Organization must be a registered bona fide 501(c)(3) and must be located in Southwestern Pennsylvania, Northeastern Ohio or Northern West Virginia.	‚Ä¢	The donation must be used as a silent auction or raffle item; it should NOT be used as a door prize.	‚Ä¢       We do not accept requests for tickets.	‚Ä¢	All donations must be picked up or a mailing address needs provided.	‚Ä¢	Donations are generally a Penguins themed goodie bag or an autographed player print that can be used to create a Penguins gift basket for your event.	‚Ä¢	Larger donations of tickets, autographed memorabilia, etc. are considered on a case-by-case basis.

Any items sent to us or dropped off will automatically be returned to the sender.	To learn more & apply, click here!

Charitable Giving
The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation thanks you for your desire to include our organization in your upcoming event and we wish you great success with your fundraiser. We are dedicated to serving our region through our pillars of giving: Education, Wellness, Community, and Youth Hockey. The Foundation places an emphasis on programs that strive to support strong futures for children and their families.
The Foundation would like to accommodate all requests received; however, due to the vast number of requests we receive on a regular basis it is impossible to do so. The following Donation Guidelines were developed to create consistency and fairness to organizations seeking our support.
Donation Guidelines
The Foundation strives to support initiatives that fall under our 4 Pillars: Education, Community, Wellness, and Youth Hockey along with these guidelines:
The Foundation donates Pittsburgh Penguins branded gift items to nonprofit and charitable fundraising events throughout the local, western Pennsylvania tri-state area.	Through our charitable donations program, we do not make contributions to amateur or school sports teams with the exception of Youth Hockey.	We do not donate to individual fundraisers for national campaigns (i.e. United Way, Relay for Life, etc.) because we contribute to those charities directly.	The Foundation will only donate to an organization once in a 12-month period.	We do not accept requests for tickets.	Please note that we do not consider donation requests for for-profit organizations/groups or if the donation would not be used for fundraising (i.e. employee recognition/incentive programs, door prizes, family reunions, weddings, etc.).	The Foundation does not accept items (i.e. jerseys, sticks or photos) from any organization to be autographed for fundraising events. Any items sent to us or dropped off will automatically be returned to the sender. We also do not guarantee any autographed items will be provided in our donations.	All requests must be received six weeks prior to your event by completing the Donation Request Form on this website. Please complete all fields on the form.	Submission of this application does not guarantee a donation. If your donation request is approved, a Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation representative will contact you regarding next steps.
Approximately two weeks prior to your event date, you will receive an email regarding the status of your donation request. Due to the large number of requests, we do not accept phone calls or emails regarding the status of a particular request.

Iceburgh, the official mascot of the Pittsburgh Penguins, has been entertaining hockey fans worldwide since 1992. As one of the Penguins' most popular ambassadors, not to mention one of the NHL's most beloved mascots, you can find Iceburgh leading cheers and dancing in the aisles at every Penguins home game, attending major hockey events around the world, visiting local schools, or just spending time at local hospitals and community events. There's no doubt about it, Iceburgh is one busy Penguin!
Iceburgh Appearance Request:	To request an Iceburgh appearance for your upcoming public or private event, click the link below and complete the online form in its entirety. Please know Iceburgh's popularity and scheduling demands sometimes cause an availability conflict, but he'll always do his best to fulfill your request.
Important details:
Iceburgh's standard appearance format is 1 hour for a set fee of $250.00. Be sure to ask about possible reduced rates for nationally-chartered 501(c)(3) non-profit charities, places of worship, and events that meet eligibility requirements!	Be sure to submit your request at least six (6) weeks prior to the event date. Your request does not guarantee an appearance nor constitute a contract. Appearances are usually confirmed 2-3 weeks prior to the event date.	Unfortunately, Iceburgh is not available on Penguins gamedays.	Travel cost (ie mileage, parking, airfare) reimbursement is required for events outside 10 miles from PPG Paints Arena. Costs, if applicable, will be reviewed in advance and added at time of final billing.

Description
During the 2024.25 season, Evgeni	Malkin	scored his 500th goal in the National Hockey League (NHL). This milestone marked the third time in franchise history that a player for the Pittsburgh Penguins has reached this accomplishment fully as a member of our organization. To celebrate this historic achievement, Wendell August Forge crafted a metal puck dated with the gameday	Malkin	‚Äôs achievement occurred forever sealing this moment in time.
Helped lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to three Stanley Cup titles (2009, ‚Äô16, 17).
Has won 6 individual NHL awards in his career. That includes two NHL scoring titles (Art Ross ‚Äì 2009, ‚Äô12), one Rookie of the Year (Calder Memorial‚Äì 2007), one NHL playoff MVP (Conn Smythe ‚Äì 2009), one Most Valuable Player (Hart Memorial Trophy‚Äì 2012) and one Most Outstanding Player of the Regular Season (Ted Lindsay Award‚Äì 2012)
In 2023, the Penguins' trio of Evgeni	Malkin	, Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang began playing with each other for the 18th consecutive season, setting a North American sports record for longest tenured trio of teammates history.
A portion of proceeds support the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Pittsburgh and Morgantown and the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation.

During the 2024.25 season, Evgeni	Malkin	scored his 500th goal in the National Hockey League (NHL). This milestone marked the third time in franchise history that a player for the Pittsburgh Penguins has reached this accomplishment fully as a member of our organization. To celebrate this historic achievement, Wendell August Forge crafted a metal puck dated with the gameday	Malkin	‚Äôs achievement occurred forever sealing this moment in time.
Helped lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to three Stanley Cup titles (2009, ‚Äô16, 17).
Has won 6 individual NHL awards in his career. That includes two NHL scoring titles (Art Ross ‚Äì 2009, ‚Äô12), one Rookie of the Year (Calder Memorial‚Äì 2007), one NHL playoff MVP (Conn Smythe ‚Äì 2009), one Most Valuable Player (Hart Memorial Trophy‚Äì 2012) and one Most Outstanding Player of the Regular Season (Ted Lindsay Award‚Äì 2012)
In 2023, the Penguins' trio of Evgeni	Malkin	, Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang began playing with each other for the 18th consecutive season, setting a North American sports record for longest tenured trio of teammates history.
A portion of proceeds support the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Pittsburgh and Morgantown and the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation.

From the Pittsburgh Pennies to hosting the best modern-day talent in the PWHL, the Penguins organization is proud to honor and celebrate the women who make a difference in the sport of hockey.	We are proud to share some of the initiatives which happened during Women's History Month 2024 below.
Krissy Wendell-Pohl Grateful for Hall of Fame Journey
During the first day of scouting meetings leading into the NHL Draft, Krissy Wendell-Pohl‚Äôs phone kept ringing with a Toronto area code.	As an amateur scout with the Penguins, she tried to remain focused on the task at hand ‚Äì but the caller was persistent.	At one point, she leaned over and asked director of player development Tom Kostopoulos, who‚Äôs from Ontario, if he had that number saved, but he did not. Finally, Wendell-Pohl received a text saying, ‚Äòhey, this is from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Can you give us a call?‚Äô	‚ÄúI'm like, oh my gosh. Then it kind of hit me, and then they called again,‚Äù she recalled with a laugh. ‚ÄúI remember thinking, ‚ÄòI should probably leave the room. I don't know how long this is going to take.‚Äô It's just‚Ä¶ my mind was spinning.‚Äù

Her Hockey Day presented by 84 Lumber
On Sunday, March 10, the Pittsburgh Penguins and Penguins Foundation hosted the 6th Annual Her Hockey Day presented by 84 Lumber.
Her Hockey Day aims to recognize the incredible passion of our women fans during the NHL‚Äôs Celebrating Women‚Äôs History Month. From girls stepping onto the ice for the first time, to women supporting the Pens from home, to those who are trailblazers for our great game, we will celebrate YOU.
Further, thanks to 84 Lumber, local women were recognized for their community engagement and empowered to continue to make Pittsburgh a city of equality.
Various programming included:
A community spotlight honoring a local woman-owned non-profit, Reshaping the Village
Honorary national anthems by Hillcrest Intermediate School All-Girl Choir
Informational tables throughout the concourse featuring organizations tied to advocating female empowerment in Western Pennsylvania, including
Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Pittsburgh	Boys & Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania	Strong Women, Strong Girls, Pittsburgh	Girl Scouts Western Pennsylvania	Gwen's Girls
PWHL Game Draws Passionate Crowd in Steel City
A crowd of 8,850 packed the lower bowl to watch	Toronto‚Äôs 2-1 victory over Montr√©al	, which is the highest-attended women‚Äôs hockey game in Pittsburgh history. It was excellent attendance, especially considering the Penguins played twice over a busy weekend that also featured St. Patrick‚Äôs Day festivities, including later that evening against the Red Wings.
‚ÄúHonestly, like, just to see how much support we're getting‚Ä¶ the phrase ‚Äòyou build it and they will come‚Äô is so real, and it's happening,‚Äù said Montr√©al forward Kristin O‚ÄôNeill, who scored her first of the season in the contest.

Kayla Brown	As a nurse in the UPMC Passavant‚ÄìCranberry Emergency Department (ED), Kayla Brown, RN, sees many people on their worst day.	She strives to do everything she can to improve those days by being a positive presence.	‚ÄúTo be a positive person as much as possible, depending on the situation, can be so impactful for these patients and their families,‚Äù says Kayla, a professional staff nurse at UPMC Passavant‚ÄìCranberry.	For always looking out for her patients, Kayla is this month‚Äôs UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero Spotlight.	Kayla has worked at UPMC Passavant‚ÄìCranberry since 2018. She says she always felt drawn to the emergency department.	‚ÄúYou are there by the patient‚Äôs side during the good times, the bad times, the victories, the failures, all of that,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt's a beautiful thing to be a part of that. And I've always wanted to be that positive person because, especially in emergency medicine, I'm meeting patients on the worst day of their lives or what they believe is the worst day of their lives.‚Äù	Soon after Kayla became a nurse, she took training to become a forensic nurse and sexual assault nurse examiner. Those nurses care for victims of sexual violence, intimate partner violence, child abuse, elder abuse, and more.	‚ÄúForensic nursing is always something I've been interested in because you can make such an impact,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt's not an immediate impact. It's not an instant satisfaction with these cases because they take a long time to go through the court systems and whatnot. But to be that one person that can sit there and just listen to these patients and process their accounts of what happened and be their advocate ‚Ä¶ is just an amazing opportunity.‚Äù	Betsy Tedesco, DNP, clinical director, Emergency Services, UPMC Passavant, says Kayla ‚Äúgoes above and beyond with compassion, drive, and empathy.‚Äù Those qualities help her to succeed at work.	‚ÄúDespite the patients in the ED experiencing a stressful situation, Kayla always makes them comfortable, safe, and protected,‚Äù Betsy says. ‚ÄúShe communicates openly and makes sure that the patients and their loved ones have their questions or concerns answered.‚Äù	Kayla also is among the first people to volunteer to take on a responsibility, Betsy says. She was the first employee to volunteer to work in UPMC Passavant‚Äôs COVID-19 monoclonal antibody clinic, which provided treatments to COVID-19 patients.	She also leads her department‚Äôs employee experience council, which strives to build teamwork, communication, collaboration, and positive relationships.	‚ÄúWhen you have the ability to openly communicate with each other, the patients have a better outcome,‚Äù Kayla says. ‚ÄúThey have a better experience because everybody's collaborating together on what we could do for this patient.‚Äù	Betsy says the council was a major undertaking, but Kayla made it a priority. It‚Äôs an example of her dedicated approach to her job.	‚ÄúKayla is always hard-working, dedicated, compassionate, committed, and a true servant leader,‚Äù Betsy says. ‚ÄúShe is always two feet first into any situation, always there to help, and always provides support to those around her.‚Äù	Kayla acknowledges that working in the emergency department can be emotionally taxing. But she comes to work to help patients in their most stressful situations and give them the answers they need.	‚ÄúThey're so incredibly vulnerable that whole time,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúJust a smile or just sitting down next to them, even if it's for 30 seconds, can make such a significant difference, and it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù	‚ÄúTo be able to give them an answer and help them get through this time (is so important).‚Äù

The Penguins Pledge is a sustainability initiative which serves as the organization's commitment to improve all efforts of social, economic and environmental sustainability.	This initiative is a collaborative effort with key partners with the goal of reducing negative impact on the environment and promoting sustainable practices to help preserve natural resources, while also supporting economic and social development.
PPG Sets 2030 Sustainability Goals, Including Science-Based Emissions Reduction Targets
PPG is committed to using resources efficiently, developing industry-leading sustainably advantaged solutions, and prioritizing decarbonization to protect the world for current and future generations.
In 2023, PPG became the first U.S.-based coatings manufacturer to receive validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for 2030 scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reduction targets. As part of these targets, the company also introduced further 2030 sustainability goals that focus on driving sales of sustainably advantaged products, reducing its environmental impact, and making a difference in communities.
PPG‚Äôs paints, coatings and specialty materials protect and beautify the world, many of which offer benefits that support its customers' sustainability ambitions. In 2023, 44% of PPG sales were from sustainably advantaged products and processes that address multiple sustainability benefits, including lower emissions, lower toxicity, energy efficiency, use of renewable raw materials or extending durability.
PPG‚Äôs Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report details advancements in its sustainably advantaged innovations, governance of ESG, efforts to reach its 2030 targets and further actions to support customers' sustainability goals. The report is available at	ppg.com/sustainability	.
Score for the Trees
The Pittsburgh Penguins and The Davey Tree Expert Company have partnered to plant trees in the greater Pittsburgh area! Every goal scored by a Penguin on home ice adds a number to the tree counter. The two organizations will work with Tree Pittsburgh to plant the total number of trees in or around the city to help restore the urban forest in Pittsburgh.	We have planted 273 trees thanks to all of the Penguins home goals scored in the 2022.23 and 2023.24 seasons!	"This partnership with the Penguins is exciting because it's making Pittsburgh a greener space for the residents, businesses, and overall community, which is proven to have tremendous health and economic benefits," said Sandra Reid, vice president of corporate communications and strategic planning at Davey Tree. "Cities across the country need to expand and reestablish their urban forests, so it's great to be included in Pittsburgh's mission to do so, and Davey is thrilled to be a part of the process."

Together, PPG, the Penguins, and PRC have been able to help safely dispose of 135,000 pounds of chemical waste, keeping the materials out of homes and garages, while diverting them from our soil, air, and water.
Making a Home for Bald Eagles
For the past few years, a pair of bald eagles, named "Irvin" and "Claire" (after U.S. Steel's Clairton plant) have been thriving on property at U. S. Steel's Mon Valley Works Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, PA. U. S. Steel shares the beauty of these majestic birds with the community through the installation of live cameras. This is believed to be the first such camera at a steel plant and only the third camera of its kind in Pennsylvania.	Click below to catch a live look at "Irvin and Claire" via two live cameras.

Powering Our Past and Pioneering Our Future
Have you ever thought about how steel shapes our world? It's not just about towering skyscrapers or massive bridges. Steel has been the backbone of our past and it‚Äôs essential to a sustainable future. At U. S. Steel, we are building the future of steel and we're building it one innovation at a time.	We recently turned two diesel locomotives at our Mon Valley Works into eco-friendly, battery-powered machines. The locomotives, which travel within the facilities carrying steel, coke, scrap metal, iron ore, and other materials necessary for production, are expected to reduce airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions by .385 tons - the equivalent emissions of 7,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.	As we march towards our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, every step counts. Environmental stewardship isn't just a fancy term for us. It's at the core of everything we do, embedded deep in our S.T.E.E.L. Principles. We're talking about a serious commitment to safeguarding our natural resources. After all, our communities, our ecosystems, and heck, our entire planet's future depends on it.

Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists - National Aviary and EQT Partnership
Thanks to a generous grant from EQT Corporation and the EQT Foundation, National Aviary educators and their flock of Ambassador Birds went on the road during the 2023.24 school year, bringing the Aviary to rural Pennsylvania classrooms. The Aviary presented conservation messaging through 10 in-class and assembly programs to schools outside of Allegheny County.	The National Aviary and EQT‚Äôs outreach program, Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists, was a tremendous success, teaching concepts in science, technology, engineering, environmental literacy, and sustainability (STEELS), as well as math, geography, wildlife conservation, and more, free of charge to schools.	‚ÄúThe live owl is the best! We learned about owls, predator/prey, nocturnal animals, in Kindergarten! They were so excited afterwards, that's all they talked about. It was excellent! I hope this continues every year!‚Äù‚ÄîKindergarten teacher from Kiski Area School District	In 2023.24, because of the EQT Foundation‚Äôs support, the National Aviary met with approximately 2,840 rural students and 133 educators‚Äîa 28 percent increase in the number of students from 2022-2023!	Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists significantly impacts students by providing an engaging, fun science program to thousands of children who are able to apply new information about birds, their native habitats, the environmental pressures they face, and the role that humans play in creating or mitigating these challenges, inspiring conservation action. This is a true partnership between EQT, the Aviary, and teachers and school districts in rural counties.	Through the ongoing partnership with EQT and the EQT Foundation, the National Aviary will continue to work with rural schools in the 2024.25 school year.
