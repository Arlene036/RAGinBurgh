        "The Pittsburgh Penguins (colloquially known as the Pens) are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh. The Penguins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference, and have played their home games at PPG Paints Arena, originally known as Consol Energy Center, since 2010. The team previously played at the Civic Arena, which was also known as Mellon Arena from 1999 to 2010, and by its nickname \"the Igloo\". The Penguins are affiliated with two minor league teams \u2013 the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL.\n",
        "Founded during the 1967 expansion, the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals, winning the Stanley Cup five times \u2013 in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017. Along with the Edmonton Oilers, the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non-Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the salary cap era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, including co-owner Mario Lemieux, who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, Sidney Crosby, and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise.\n",

                "Prior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL'sPittsburgh Piratesfrom 1925 to 1930 and of theAmerican Hockey League'sPittsburgh Hornetsfranchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965,Jack McGregor, astate senatorfromKittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as anurban renewaltool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that includedH. J. Heinz CompanyheirH. J. Heinz III,Pittsburgh Steelers' ownerArt Rooneyand theMellon family'sRichard Mellon Scaife. Theprojected league expansiondepended on securing votes from thethen-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes fromJames D. Norris, owner of theChicago Black Hawksand his brotherBruce Norris, owner of theDetroit Red Wings. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, theNational Hockey Leagueawarded anexpansion teamto Pittsburgh for the1967–68 season. The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($23.8 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($6.9 million today) more for start-up costs. TheCivic Arena's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.[5][6]",
                "A contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with theathletic departmentof the newly namedYoungstown State Universityin nearbyYoungstown, Ohio. (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with theCleveland Baronsin the mid-1970s.) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the \"Igloo\", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena),[7][8]a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the \"Golden Triangle\" of downtown Pittsburgh.[7][9]The Penguins' first general manager,Jack Riley, opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise inBrantford, Ontario,[10]on September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against thePhiladelphia Flyerson September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"Original Six\" teams hampered the Pens, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniperAndy Bathgate, all-star defensemanLeo Boivin(who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) andNew York Rangers' veteranEarl Ingarfield, a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingersVal FonteyneandAb McDonald, and goaltendersHank BassenandJoe Daley.George Sullivanwas named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain.[11]",
                "On October 11, 1967, league presidentClarence Campbelland McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against theMontreal Canadiens.[5]On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2. However, the Penguins went 27–34–13 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtimeCleveland BaronsAHL goaltenderLes Binkley, who recorded a 2.88goals-against averageand was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive wingerKen Schinkelwon the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in theNHL All-Star Game. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to theSt. Louis Bluesin exchange for centerLou Angotti.[6]",
                "Thenext seasonsaw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players—including longtime future Pens starJean Pronovost—making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains."

                    "In the1969 draftthe Penguins selectedMichel Brierewho, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons toPhil EspositoandBobby Clarke. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second inCalder Memorial Trophyvoting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltenderTony Esposito. Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated theOakland Sealsin a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semi-final round, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game-winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his nativeQuebec, suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001.[6]",
                    "In the1970–71 season, the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21–37–20 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in1972, only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost,Syl Apps Jr.,Keith McCreary, agitatorBryan Watsonand goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972.\nThe Penguins battled theCalifornia Golden Sealsfor the division cellar in1974, when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced byJack Button. Button obtainedSteve Durbano,Ab DeMarco,Bob \"Battleship\" KellyandBob Paradisethrough trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28–41–9 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth.",
                    "However, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team intobankruptcy. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate.[12]Around the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated toSeattleandDenverrespectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the1976–77 season.[13]Through the intervention of a group that included formerMinnesota North Starshead coachWren Blair, the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought byshopping mallmagnateEdward J.

                    "Beginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of Syl Apps,Lowell MacDonaldand Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the Stanley Cup semi-finals in1975, but were ousted from the playoffs by theNew York Islandersin one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season.Baz Bastien, a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in1977–78. Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over theBuffalo Sabresbefore a second-round sweep at the hands of theBoston Bruins.[6]",
                    "The Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, thePittsburgh Piratesand the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as theFlag of Pittsburgh. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980.[14]On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defensemanRandy Carlyle, and prolific scorersPaul GardnerandMike Bullardbut little else.",
                    "During the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the1982 playoffs, the Penguins held a 3–1 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal byJohn Tonelli, who had tied the game before.[15]It would be the Pens' final playoff appearance until1989."

With the team suffering financial problems, it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate.Mario Lemieux, one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the1984 NHL Entry Draft. Heading towards the end of the season ahead of theNew Jersey Devils, who were placed last, the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term. They posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils' management.[16]Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, saying in an interview with thePittsburgh Post-Gazettethat a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted.[17]Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defensemanPaul Coffeyfrom theEdmonton Oilers(after the Oilers'1987 Stanley Cupwin) and bringing in young talent like scorersKevin Stevens,Rob BrownandJohn Cullenfrom the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition ofTom Barrassofrom Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Pens; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. The1985–86Pens missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In1986–87, they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In1987–88, for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game.[11]",
                "In 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Pens shocked the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game.[11]"

                    "Aherniated discin Lemieux's back cut short his1989–90 season, although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings (Bryan Trottier) and trades (Joe Mullen,Larry Murphy,Ron FrancisandUlf Samuelsson) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins draftedJaromir Jagrwith the fifth overall pick in the1990 NHL Entry Draft. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.\nThe roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in theStanley Cup Finalsin six games, punctuated by an 8–0 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the1991 Stanley Cup Finals, the Penguins met with PresidentGeorge H. W. Bush, the first NHL team ever to visit theWhite House.[18]The following season, the team lost coachBob Johnsontocancer, andScotty Bowmantook over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in1991–92.[6][11]",

Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourthArt Ross Trophyas scoring champion with 160 points, edging outPat LaFontaineandAdam Oates. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56–21–7 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning thePresidents' Trophy. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it ever had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of this success, the New York Islanders eliminated them in the second round of Game 7 in overtime.[11][6]",
                    "The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards:Alexei Kovalev,Martin Straka,Aleksey Morozov,Robert LangandPetr Nedved, and defensemenSergei Zubov,Darius KasparaitisandKevin Hatcher. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to theWashington Capitalsin six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to theFlorida Panthersin seven games).

Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into theHockey Hall of Famein the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived.

At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-ownersHoward BaldwinandMorris Belzberg(who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file forChapter 11bankruptcy in November 1998.",

The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity—enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoonRonald Burkle) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time.[6]",

Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, after developing anirregular heartbeat, this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), and with the second-highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second toWayne Gretzky's 1.92.[31][32]",

In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top-scoring rookie in Penguin history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top-two pick in four years, in the2006 NHL Entry Draft, and selected touted two-way forwardJordan Staal.
