If I need additional tickets can I get them at the discounted price?
Additional tickets can be purchased at the discounted group rate, based on availability.

This provides fans with greater price flexibility based on real-time market conditions.

Each ticket has a mobile ticket barcode that must be scanned for entry into PNC Park via your mobile device. Within the Wallet, you can tap on an individual ticket to view its barcode. For entry to PNC Park, present your mobile device with the mobile barcode open and available to scan.
How do I access the ticket to scan for entry?

Why is my ticket barcode not showing in the MLB Ballpark app?

For further assistance, contact Pirates Fans Services at	[email protected]	or 1-800-BUY-BUCS.
I just forwarded a ticket via the MLB Ballpark app. Why do I still see it?
Your ticket, without the barcode, will remain in your Tickets tab’s Wallet until your forward is accepted by the recipient. If you wish to cancel the forward, you can do that directly from the ticket.
During what window of time can I forward tickets to friends?
You can forward tickets via the MLB Ballpark app from the moment you purchase them until two hours after the first pitch of that day's game as long as that ticket has not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park.
What should I do if I need to enter PNC Park for the start of the game and the rest of my group is not here yet?
You can easily forward tickets to friends via the MLB Ballpark app up to two hours after the start of that day's game as long as the tickets have not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park.

Yes. From the bottom of the ticket inside the MLB Ballpark app you can tap the "Add to Wallet" button to add your ticket to Apple Wallet.
Can I use Google Pay for my Pirates tickets?
No. Support for adding tickets to Google Pay is not yet available from the MLB Ballpark app.
Why won't my ticket barcode scan?
If your screen brightness is too low, the barcode may have difficulty being scanned. The MLB Ballpark app will automatically attempt to increase the brightness of your display or you can do so manually by following the instructions for your device. Please note, cracked screens may impact your barcode's ability to scan. The barcode displayed is accompanied by a number. If there are difficulties reading a valid barcode on a digital ticket displayed within the MLB Ballpark app, visit the PNC Park Ticket Office.
What if I lose connectivity after I've retrieved my tickets?
As long as you have previously viewed your tickets, you will still be able to view your tickets in the MLB Ballpark app even with low connectivity. We recommend viewing and loading your tickets prior to arriving at PNC Park or adding to your Apple Wallet to ensure they are accessible regardless of connectivity.
If I access my tickets from the MLB Ballpark app, can I still have them printed at a Will Call window?
Since tickets retrieved within the MLB Ballpark app will now be considered printed, the tickets will not be available for pickup at Will Call. You should present the ticket displayed in the MLB Ballpark app on your mobile device for entry at the gate. If you are unable to access your ticket, go to a Ticket Office window for assistance on game day. If you have any questions, please contact Pirates Fans Services at	[email protected]	or 1-800-BUY-BUCS.

MLB BALLPARK APP - TICKET FORWARDING
What is Ticket Forwarding?
The MLB Ballpark app allows you to easily forward tickets to family, friends, colleagues, account partners and others with whom you wish to share your tickets so that they can use their ticket on their personal phone.
How do I forward a ticket?
From the Tickets tab’s Wallet tap on a game to access a list of your tickets. At the bottom of the list tap "Forward Ticket". Select the ticket(s) you wish to forward then choose "Select From Contacts", "Via Email", or “Share Link’. Selecting "Forward Ticket" again prompts you to enter an email address or choose a friend from your Address Book. You can then add the recipient's name (optional) and a message (optional) before tapping "Send" to complete the forward. If you wish to send by another method, you can tap "Share Link" which will provide you a unique link to share. You can also quickly send tickets to friends you’ve forwarded to recently by tapping on their email!
Will the MLB Ballpark app automatically link to the contacts that exist in My Pirates Tickets?
No. At this time, "My Pirates Tickets" contacts will not automatically link to the MLB Ballpark app. However, the MLB Ballpark app will automatically link to the address book and contacts in your mobile device.
How does Forwarding a Ticket via "Share Link" work?
A unique link, which holds the key to your ticket, will be generated and you can distribute it as you see fit. Please only share this link with one person to whom you are forwarding your ticket. If you share the link with multiple recipients, whomever clicks that link and completes the "forward accept" process first will get that ticket.
What if I accidentally send the ticket to the wrong email address?
You can easily cancel a ticket forward that is in a pending state directly from your list of tickets inside the Wallet. You can then resend the ticket to the correct email address.
How will my recipient know I forwarded tickets?
Both you and the recipient will receive an email that notifies that the ticket forward has been initiated. The recipient will have a unique link in the email to accept the ticket. If you selected "Share Link," the recipient will receive the notification by whatever method you selected for delivering the link.
How do I accept a ticket forward?
You must click "Accept" from the email invitation you received. If you do not already have the MLB Ballpark app on your supported iOS or Android device, you will be prompted to download the app.
I do not have a supported iOS or Android device. Can I still accept a ticket forward?
Yes, you can accept and receive your tickets in a standard web browser. Once a ticket forward has been accepted, contact Pirates Fans Services at	[email protected]	or 1-800-BUY-BUCS.
What if the email address where I received the ticket forward is not the same as the email address associated with my MLB account?
The email address at which you received your tickets does not need to match the email address associated with your MLB account, but you will be required to click the link in the email where the ticket was forwarded to.
Can I reject a ticket forward?
Yes, just click, "I do not want to accept this ticket" on the Ticket Accept webpage. This webpage is accessible only from the ticket forward email sent to the recipient. The sender of the ticket forward will be informed that the invitation was rejected and will continue to have access to the ticket in their MLB Ballpark app
If I receive a forwarded ticket, can I re-forward that ticket to another recipient?
Yes, a ticket can be forwarded again. Each time a ticket is forwarded, the two participants, the sender and the recipient, will receive a notification of this transaction
Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward?
Yes, the sender can cancel a ticket forward any time before the barcode has been scanned. This can be accomplished from the Wallet tab by selecting an individual ticket and tapping "Cancel" or by clicking on the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. Select the specific Forward then tap "Cancel Forward." The recipient of the ticket you forwarded will be notified.
Can I cancel or recall a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted?
Yes, the original ticket sender can cancel or recall a ticket forward after it has been accepted. The sender and recipient will be notified by email of this action and the ticket will disappear from the recipient's (or anyone they may have forwarded it to) Wallet tab. However, once the ticket has been scanned for entry, the ticket cannot be recalled.
Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted and re-sent?
Yes, the original ticket owner can cancel the forward for a ticket to a Pirates home game regardless of how many times it has been re-forwarded as long as it has not been scanned for entry yet. The sender and original recipient will be notified by email of this action, and the ticket will disappear from the Wallet Tab and/or My Pirates Tickets account of whomever the ticket had last been forwarded to.
Can I forward multiple Pirates tickets to a single account?
Yes. Tickets can be forwarded together from the same event or one ticket at a time.
Where can I find the status of all Pirates Ticket Forwards?
You can navigate to the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. There, you will find all received and sent ticket forwards for your account.
What if I never received the Ticket Forward email?
If you are expecting to receive a ticket forward but were never notified by email, contact the sender. The sender can cancel the current Ticket Forward then re-send to you by email or share link. If you or the sender are still having difficulties, contact Pirates Fans Services at	[email protected]	or 1-800-BUY-BUCS.
If the person I forward tickets to deletes the email they received to accept the ticket(s) before they click "Accept," what should I do?
The ticket owner should cancel their original ticket forward and then re-forward the ticket via the MLB Ballpark app so the recipient receives a new email through which to accept the ticket(s).

Greg’s association with the Pirates began in 1979, when he interned in the promotions department while attending Point Park University. Following the World Series that year, Brown worked as the clubhouse manager at Pirate City during the Instructional League program in Bradenton, Florida. His 10-year stint in the Bucs front office included work in the Marketing, Public Relations and Broadcasting departments. Greg also served as the team’s public address announcer during the 1987 campaign. In 1988, he was a sports anchor on WFMJ-TV in Youngstown, OH. Prior to joining Pittsburgh’s broadcast team in 1994, Brown spent five seasons (1989-1993) doing play-by-play and color commentary for the Buffalo Bisons of the American Association (now International League) as well as hosting a sportstalk show on WGR Radio. He also worked as a color analyst and a pre and postgame show host for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League for five seasons (1989-93). Brown’s dedication and passion for the Pirates extends to his efforts away from the broadcast booth as he makes numerous off-season appearances in the community, both in the Pittsburgh area and in Bradenton during spring training. Brown is a native of Washington, D.C. He currently resides in Renfrew, PA, with his wife, Kim, and their son.
Joe Block	Joe Block is in his ninth season of calling Pirates play-by-play action, having joined the TV and radio broadcast teams in 2016. Though having grown up in and outside Detroit, Block considers making his home in Pittsburgh “a dream,” as his grandparents and great-grandparents originally settled in the region, in Wheeling, WV and Byesville, OH. As a teenager, Block traveled to Pittsburgh on spring break to take in Penguins games at the Igloo. Block has called baseball for 20 seasons, previously with the Milwaukee Brewers and in the minor leagues in Billings, MT, Great Falls, MT, Jacksonville, FL, St. Paul, MN, and Charleston, SC. He also broadcast for the Los Angeles Dodgers, New Orleans Hornets, Montreal Expos and for various regional TV networks since graduating from Michigan State in 1999.

He made his big league debut with the Phillies in 1980 and was the starting pitcher in Game One of the World Series that October against Kansas City. In the spring of 1981, Walk was dealt to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Gary Matthews. He spent three seasons in the Atlanta organization before being acquired by Pittsburgh in 1984. Bob was a 1988 National League All-Star and he posted six straight winning seasons from 1987 to 1992.

2023 PNC PARK ENHANCEMENTS
POPS' PLAZA	Fans will notice a new and improved experience in the familiar Pops' Plaza. Additional technology upgrades include self-ordering kiosks allowing fans to place their order at multiple stands in one transaction, thus improving wait times.
FAN FAVORITES ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE	Continuing through the main concourse, fans can enjoy a selection of fan favorites including several new beer markets, ballpark fare and a redesigned concourse embracing Pittsburgh's history and personality.
THE MARKET	"As we continue to enhance PNC Park, our goal is to build upon what makes it so special and provide an exciting and memorable game day experience," said Pirates President Travis Williams. "The improvements to our main concourse come after discussions with our fans. These upgrades to improve entry into the ballpark, flow of the concourse and speed of service are a result of that feedback."
NEW SCOREBOARD	The new scoreboard in left field is more than double the size of the previous display, without taking away from the unrivaled views of Downtown Pittsburgh's skyline. A modern 10-millimeter pixel spacing display, resulting in more than 4K pixels in width, will yield stunningly clear imagery to fans throughout the ballpark.
2022 PNC PARK ENHANCEMENTS
FAT HEAD'S BULLPEN BAR	Replacing the former gameday security building, the creation of this new gathering space above the center field bullpens includes two rows of drink rails, comfortable seating, televisions and more. Like all of the new spaces, the Fat Head's Bullpen Bar offers a great view of the action on the field, so fans won’t miss a minute of the game while enjoying a craft beer on the Riverwalk.
KIDS PLAY AREAS	The kids play area in right field has been refreshed and is now expanded to flow along the Riverwalk into the center field area. The expansion features life-sized bobbleheads, a Lucky Climber shaped like a pirate ship, as well as an accessible kid's play bridge inspired by the nearby Roberto Clemente Bridge. The evolution of the play area allows families to enjoy the play elements while remaining connected to the action on the field.
THE MILLER LITE LANDING	Located just above the Center Field fenceline, The Miller Lite Landing offers a fantastic view of the action on the field, as well as the perfect view back to the Roberto Clemente Bridge and downtown cityscape. The new social gathering space features new drink rails, tables and high-top seating creating a relaxed environment for all fans.
NEW FOOD CONCEPTS	Together with ARAMARK, the Pirates have partnered with local Pittsburgh chefs to create new food concepts and specialty offerings. The new concepts are featured throughout the Riverwalk and in the arcade under the left field bleachers. This includes Cannonball Burger, inspired by Station in Bloomfield, Chicken on the Hill, inspired by Coop de Ville in the Strip District, and Deli Dogs, inspired by Smallman Street Deli.
THE PATIO	Located between the Upper and Lower Bleacher seating areas in left field, The Patio is a newly widened and leveled area that extends from the bullpens to the Left Field Rotunda. The expansion of this platform and new furniture allows for a comfortable gathering space overlooking left field.
AHN PICNIC PARK	Always a fantastic place to host groups, The Picnic Park will now feature upgraded furnishings, enhanced lighting and landscaping, as well as additional access points for greater connection to the new fan enhancements along the Riverwalk.
LEFT FIELD LOUNGE	The Left Field Lounge exterior is now modified to create one large open platform with a new picket style drink rail that runs the length of the space. These enhancements improve the fan experience by allowing groups to comfortably move about the space, all while allowing for improved sight lines from within the Left Field Lounge.
CINDERLANDS CORNER BAR	Open to all fans, The Cinderlands Corner Bar is a gathering space below the Left Field Rotunda featuring specialty drinks, local craft beers as well as fan favorite traditional Pittsburgh brews. The area connects the fans in the Cinderlands Corner Bar to the action on the field. The open feel and additional TVs and furniture provide a more fan friendly environment.
CELEBRATING HISTORY	Retired numbers inspired by the steel design of the nearby three sister bridges and oversized baseballs, celebrating Pittsburgh's rich baseball history, are meticulously positioned throughout the landscaping of the Lower Riverwalk for visitors to enjoy year around.

PNC PARK FEATURES
Overview	Facts	Firsts
arrow-expand-504630	arrow-contract-504631
The Ballpark	PNC Park, which opened in spring 2001, is a classic-style ballpark, an intimate facility that embraces the progressiveness of Pittsburgh while saluting the spirit of early ballpark originals such as Forbes Field, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. It is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates since their inception in 1887.	This riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks - rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field - with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort.	Location	PNC Park's prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. It also provides easy access for pedestrians crossing the Roberto Clemente bridge from downtown, as well as those arriving from the riverwalk. On game days, the bridge is closed off to vehicular traffic and spectators are met by a dynamic interactive retail/restaurant and sports pavilion beyond right field, with attractions for all ages.	Design	The facility was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK), Inc. out of Kansas City, MO. The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh.	PNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line.	PNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also orientated to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond.	The home of the Pirates is instantly recognizable as a ballpark, with architectural flourishes of Forbes Field lending a touch of nostalgia. The series of masonry archways extending along the entry level facade and decorative terra cotta tiled pilasters exude the charm of the club's former home of 61 years.	Features	Among the features of the beautiful facility are 69 suites with their own concourse level, club seating at both the field and mezzanine levels with their own respective lounges, an outfield barbecue run by former Pirate Manny Sanguillen, an outdoor river terrace and river walk. PNC Park also features the Left Field Lounge & Jim Beam Porch, offering a casual dining and sports bar atmosphere with wait service before, during and after every game for all ticket holders. The ballpark houses retail areas along the Federal Street and General Robinson Street corridor, including Slice on Broadway, the Pirates Clubhouse Store, PNC Bank and the Pirates administrative and ticket offices.	Playing Field	The irregularly shaped, natural grass playing field measures 325 feet down the left foul line and 389 feet through the left field power alley. The park reaches its greatest distance of 410 feet at a nook located just left of center field. The distance down the right field foul line is 320 feet, 375 feet down the power alley, and 399 feet to center field. The outfield wall rises up to 21 feet behind right field (in honor of the Pirates legendary right fielder #21, Roberto Clemente) and drops down to just six feet in front of the left field bleachers. From home plate to the Allegheny River is 443 feet, 4 inches.	The Pirates and the Park	Perhaps the strongest inspiration for PNC Park's design is the legacy of the Pirates themselves. Few cities can boast of a 115-year relationship with the same Major League ballclub. Pittsburgh deserves nothing less than a ballpark classic that will enthrall fans for generations to come.

LET'S GO BUCS. LET'S GO GREEN.
DUQUESNE LIGHT POWER HITTERS PROGRAM	The Pirates and Duquesne Light teamed up for a unique Power Hitters Program that resulted in 282 trees being planted in Pittsburgh over the course of the 2021 and 2022 season. These trees were planted in underserved communities and targeted historically marginalized neighborhoods because research shows these neighborhoods are more susceptible to "heat island impacts," which can cause impaired water quality, increased energy consumption, and compromised health quality. The neighborhoods are urban areas with buildings, roads, and other infrastructure that absorb the suns heat more than naturally landscaped areas. This causes the neighborhoods to become "islands" of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas.
PNC PARK URBAN GARDEN
Pittsburgh Pirates continue to maintain the PNC Park Urban Garden. The Urban Garden uses sustainable practices and provides vegetables and herbs, grown on-site, to be used in Pirates players' favorite healthy dishes prepared by the Pirates Executive Chef Tony Palatucci.	Learn More
RECYCLING
Just like families at home, our Pirates family works hard each season to reduce, reuse and recycle, not just on Earth Day, but every day. In over a decade of sustainability efforts at PNC Park, the Pirates and our partners have recycled...
Cardboard
1,825 Tons	That’s the equivalent weight of over 200 T-Rex dinos!
Fryer Oil
219 Tons	This oil is recycled and eventually used as biofuel.
Other Recyclables
2,492 Tons	Including electronics, toner cartridges, metal, batteries, and more.
Plastic
793 Tons	Including 1.3 million plastic bottles used by fans each season.
Mixed Paper
206 Tons	Plus, all paper in the front office is at least 30% post-consumer material.
Aluminum
521 Tons	Since we have started recycling, we have recycled 521 tons of aluminum.
COMPOSTING
Food	9,171 Tons
Yard Waste	2,037 Tons
What is composting, anyway?	Composting is organic recycling. Composting allows for the controlled collection of food & organic material, rather than waste-producing methane gas during decomposition in landfills. Direct benefits to soil include increased aeration and structural stability, improved activity of beneficial micro-organisms, faster root development, and ultimately higher yields of agricultural crops.	Consider this: If just 25 Pirates fans diverted their food waste to composting for one year, it would equal eliminating the emissions from a 6,000-mile train trip!
FOOD DONATIONS	Over 29,450 pounds of food was donated between Pirates Executive Chef Tony and Aramark to 412 Food Rescue in 2023.
The Pirates sustainability practices successfully divert more than 70-percent of the ballpark waste out of the waste stream each year, equivalent to more than 1,650 tons of materials.
Averaged a 70% diversion rate since the inception of the Pirates sustainability efforts.	71% Diversion rate in 2023	Diverted over 1664 tons of materials from landfills in 2023.	7-time winners of the Green Glove Award for the National League Central.

Take a walk along the streets right outside PNC Park and discover four legends forever immortalized with a statue.
FEDERAL STREET
Along Federal Street, you'll find:
Roberto Clemente statue in Center Field	The Roberto Clemente statue was dedicated on July 8, 1994, to kick off All-Star Week in Pittsburgh. It was originally erected outside Gate A at Three Rivers Stadium and is now located outside the Center Field Gate to PNC Park, a few steps away from the Roberto Clemente Bridge.
Willie Stargell statue in Left Field	Unveiled on April 7, 2001, the 12-foot bronze statue stands along Federal Street at the entrance to left field at PNC Park.
MAZEROSKI WAY
On Mazeroski Way, you'll find:
Bill Mazeroski statue at the end of the cul-de-sac in Right Field	As part of the 50th anniversary season of the 1960 World Series Championship, the 12-foot bronze statue was officially unveiled on September 5, 2010, and stands at the end of Mazeroski Way, which is located at the right field entrance to PNC Park.
At the corner of Mazeroski Way and General Robinson Street, you’ll find:
Honus Wagner statue at the Home Plate entrance	The Honus Wagner statue has had three different “homes” since being dedicated on April 30, 1955. Originally, the Wagner statue was located in Schenley Park, close to the Pirates early home, Forbes Field. It was then moved to Three Rivers Stadium and erected outside Gate C on July 21, 1972. The statue is now located at the home plate entrance to PNC Park.

JIM LEYLAND NATIONAL BASEBALL HOF TRAVEL PACKAGES
Jim Leyland was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Contemporary Era Committee, which is composed of seven Hall of Fame members, six long-time baseball executives and three media members/historians.	Leyland, who managed 11 of his 22 years as a member of the Pirates, will be the 44th former player, manager or executive in the Hall of Fame who spent some of their professional careers with the Pirates, including 2013 Pre-Integration Era inductee Deacon White, who played for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys in 1889. Fourteen of the other 43 spent a majority of their career with the Pirates, including Jake Beckley, Max Carey, Fred Clarke, Roberto Clemente, owner Barney Dreyfuss, Ralph Kiner, Bill Mazeroski, Willie Stargell, Pie Traynor, Arky Vaughan, Honus Wagner, Lloyd Waner and Paul Waner.	Leyland managed the Pirates from 1986-96 and led the team to three straight appearances in the National League Championship Series from 1990-92. During his 11 years as manager of the Pirates, Leyland compiled a record of 851-863 while being named the BBWAA Manager-of-the-Year in both 1990 and 1992. He also garnered Manager-of-the-Year accolades with Detroit in 2006.

If you've purchased a subscription to At Bat or MLB.TV directly through in-app purchase from the Apple App Store (not directly from the MLB website), please review the information below..
Purchasing an Apple App Store Subscription
In-app purchases are purchased from and billed by the Apple App Store, not MLB.	These purchases are subject to the terms and conditions of the Apple App Store.	All billing and refund inquiries must be directed to the Apple App Store.	MLB does not have access to Apple App Store accounts or transactions. If you wish to confirm the type of subscription that has been purchased from the Apple App Store, please consult your Apple App Store account or receipt, as each subscription will have a unique billing name.
An At Bat or MLB.TV annual purchase is valid for one year and will be re-billed every year by the Apple App Store until canceled by the user. The Apple App Store will send an email well in advance of renewal containing a hyperlink to manage the subscription. The Apple App Store subscriptions can be managed from a mobile device or computer that uses the same Apple ID as the initial purchase. MLB cannot manage Apple App Store subscriptions.

You can only connect an Apple App Store purchase to one MLB account. If you connect the purchase to a second MLB account, the first account will lose all entitlements.

How do I access my tickets?
Ticket Purchasers
To find your purchases in the MLB Ballpark app, go to the "Tickets" tab and click "Wallet" to view the Event card for the ticket(s) that you purchased. If you don't see the Event card, tap on "Refresh" or pull down on the screen to refresh your ticketing inventory. Event cards will display for the next 5 upcoming events in your Wallet. For fans with more than 5 events in their inventory, tap the "View All" link on the top right of the wallet to view all upcoming events.	Event cards will populate provided that the email address associated with those tickets is both a) linked with your MLB account, and b) you have verified your ownership over that email. If you are still not seeing an Event card, go to the "Home" tab in the bottom navigation bar, and click on the avatar icon or your initials in the upper left-hand corner to go to your Profile. Click on My MLB Email Account Emails, where you can see any emails that are linked and whether they are verified. If you need to add another email, click on "Add Another Email" at the bottom of the screen, and follow the steps.	Click on the Event card, which will take you to your ticket(s), where you can Open tickets to view the barcode for quick and easy scanning at the gate, Add to Apple Wallet (at select Clubs), view ticket details on the ticket back (by pressing the info icon at the bottom right of the ticket face), or Forward Tickets to someone else.	If you have tickets to more than one Club that uses Tickets.com as its primary ticketing vendor, you can access tickets across any Tickets.com Club account, provided the email(s) associated with those accounts is linked.
Accepting a Ticket Forward
If you received your ticket(s) as the result of a ticket forward from another fan, you will be notified directly by email or you will receive a share link where you can accept tickets from the sender.
If you already have the MLB Ballpark app,
For email forwards, if your email that was used to receive your forwarded ticket(s) is verified, your ticket(s) will automatically be accepted and accessible via the MLB Ballpark app.	For SMS share links, you will need to tap the link, which will open the MLB Ballpark app, where your ticket(s) will automatically be accepted and accessible.
If you do not already have the MLB Ballpark app downloaded,
For email forwards, clicking "Accept Tickets" will take you to an MLB.com ticket acceptance page, where you can either accept or reject the ticket(s). Once you have accepted the ticket(s), you will be prompted to download the MLB Ballpark app, verify your account and will be able to access your tickets.	For SMS share links, clicking "Accept Tickets" will take you to an MLB.com ticket acceptance page, where you can either accept or reject the ticket(s).

The sender and recipient will be notified by email when the forward is complete.
Next, go to the "Tickets" tab and click "Wallet" to view the Event card for the ticket(s) you just accepted. If you don't see the Event card, tap on "Refresh" or pull down on the screen to refresh. Event cards will display for the next 5 upcoming events in your Wallet.

Scanning a Ticket at the Ballpark
Quickly access your tickets in the MLB Ballpark app via the "Home" tab for your next upcoming game by tapping "Open Tickets", which will take you directly to your ticket barcode(s) so you can quickly scan to enter at entrance gates. If you have more than one ticket, this view will default to your first ticket, and you can swipe left to view additional tickets in the carousel.

At select Clubs, if you have added your ticket(s) to Apple Wallet, you can use NFC (near-field communication) to tap and go for entry into the ballpark. If you have more than one ticket, this view will default to the first ticket, and you can swipe left to view and tap additional tickets in the carousel. You will need to tap each ticket on your device at the gate or else digitally forward additional tickets to others in your party.
You can also access your tickets from the "Tickets" tab, "Wallet" section. Simply tap on the Event card or click "Open Tickets", which will display a list of your tickets.

You will need to scan each ticket on your device at the gate or else digitally forward additional tickets to others in your party.
If you need additional assistance, please refer to the Verifying Accounts and Accessing Tickets section.

Click the "Forward Tickets" button at the bottom of the screen, which will enable you to select the ticket(s) you wish to transfer to someone else.

Via Email	- An email address is required; a name and message are optional.
Share Link	- A link will be copied for you to share.

To see the current status of all of your tickets, go to the "Wallet" section of the "Tickets" tab and tap on the Event card to see the status of forwarded tickets, e.g., when pending or accepted by the recipient. You can also cancel a pending Forward by clicking on "Cancel" to the right of the ticket, or you can recall an accepted ticket by clicking on "Recall" to the right of the ticket.
To track all of your sent and received forwards, go to the "Tickets" tab and tap on the ticket forward icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen.

GROUP TICKETS TOOL
The Pirates now have a new tool to help manage and share large quantities of tickets for their group events. When group leaders purchase tickets for their event, they can easily manage group members by entering their information into the tool. The tool will logically auto allocate tickets on behalf of the group leader and with one action, share tickets digitally to group members. Group leaders will also have the ability to recall the ticket and share with a different group member. Fans will need to scan their digital ticket at the gates using the MLB Ballpark app for safe and easy entry.

Access Group Tickets Tool
Frequently Asked Questions
How do I access the Group Tickets Tool?
Visit	group-tickets.mlb.com	and log in using your MLB account email address used to purchase the tickets.
What if I do not have an MLB account?
Visit	group-tickets.mlb.com	and click on the link to “Sign Up” for an MLB account. Follow the registration process and be sure to verify your email address in your email account before accessing the Group Tickets Tool.
Why verify my email?
MLB allows access and management of tickets purchased or received through any email address once you have confirmed ownership of the email account.
What if I do not see my game event displayed?
Select the refresh icon in the Upcoming Events section to refresh your ticket inventory. If you still do not see your game event, reach out to your Pirates Group Sales Representative for assistance.
How many tickets can I forward using the Group Tickets Tool?
Up to 1,000
What if I change my ticket inventory to add more tickets or return tickets?
You can also select the refresh icon in the Upcoming Events section to refresh your ticket inventory if the number of remaining tickets displayed does not match your new total count.
How do I prepare to use the Group Tickets Tool?
As a group leader, you will need to collect the following information from your group members: their name, email address, and number of seats they desire. You can store this information in any way you choose, including options like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. This will help with managing your group members information and provide an easy way to copy and paste the group member information into the tool when you’re ready to share tickets.
How do I add more than one group member’s information into the tool?
After selecting an event, you will be prompted to add multiple people to your event by copy and pasting their information or entering their information into modal.
Can I add group members individually in the tool?
Yes! After selecting an event, you will be prompted to add multiple people to your event. You have the option to cancel or close the modal to reach the Available Tickets page. On this page you can select the option to “Add Person” and enter each group member individually.
How do I edit group member’s information in the tool?
On the Available Tickets tab, select the pencil icon next to the group member you want to edit.
How do I remove a group member in the tool?
On the Available Tickets tab, select the pencil icon next to the group member you want to remove. Then select the “Remove Recipient” button and confirm you want to remove this recipient from the event. Note: ticket inventory may shift around as tickets are re-allocated after removing a recipient.
What should I do if a ticket displays as "Cannot be Shared"?
Contact your Pirates group sales representative for assistance.
How do I share tickets to group members in the tool?
On the Available Tickets tab, select the “Share Tickets” button to start the process of sharing tickets to the email addresses provided for each group member. You’ll have the option to select the tickets you want to share or you can select all tickets to be shared at once.
What does an Error status mean?
On the Shared Tickets tab, a ticket under the “Errors” section means that an error occurred when attempting to forward the ticket. You can select the “View” button to see the reason why the ticket has an error and how to troubleshoot the error. One example may be that the email address provided is not a valid email.
What does a Pending status mean?
On the Shared Tickets tab, a ticket under the “Pending” section can mean two things: either the ticket is still in the process of sending to the intended group member, or the group member does not have an MLB account. If a group member does not have an MLB account, they will need to follow the instructions provided in the ticket forward email confirmation to set up their account and accept the ticket.
What does an Accepted status mean?
On the Shared Tickets tab, a ticket under the “Accepted” section means the ticket was successfully shared and automatically accepted by the group member!
What does it mean to cancel a Pending ticket?
On the Shared Tickets tab, selecting to “Cancel” a pending ticket will stop the ticket from being accepted by the intended group member. The ticket will move back to the Available Tickets tab where you will have the option to share the ticket again.
If a group member can no longer attend a game, how do I recall a ticket?
On the Shared Tickets tab, find the group member who can no longer attend and select the “Recall” button next to their name. The tool will confirm you want to recall the ticket, and then it will pull the ticket back from that group member and put it back in your inventory. The ticket will now be displayed on the Available Tickets tab where you will have the option to share the ticket again.
How does a group member access their digital ticket?
They can log in on the MLB Ballpark app using the same email address you used to share the ticket(s), and they will be all set! They may need to create an MLB account first if they have not used the Ballpark app before.

PNC PARK TRANSPORTATION INFORMATION
Millions of fans have visited PNC Park since it opened in April 2001. Through the years, the city of Pittsburgh -- and especially the North Shore -- has continued to change and grow. While the ongoing development of our region is exciting, it also presents fans with some challenges in getting to and from the ballpark.	These pages will provide you with simple directional and parking information that will make your trips to and from PNC Park as easy and stress-free as possible. Parking lots surrounding PNC Park will include Gold 1 lot, Gold 1 garage, Gold 2 lot, Gold 4 lot, Red 5 garage, Red 5A lot, Red 6 lot, Blue 10 garage, Red 7A lot, and Red 7C lot.	In addition, the Pirates have teamed up with Waze, a community-based traffic and navigation app, to provide you with the most efficient routes to and from the game. Waze is the only GPS program that (thanks to our partnership) has PNC Park parking lots, event day traffic patterns, and street closures incorporated, providing fans with accurate directions to your specific lot with real-time traffic alerts.

Conversely, if requesting a ticket exchange from a higher-priced game into a lower-priced game, the difference in ticket value can be applied to eligible future game exchanges in the 2024 Regular Season.
There is no limit to the number of future games you may transact.
All exchanges are based on availability; the Pirates cannot guarantee that all exchanges will be available.
While all games (except Opening Day) will initially be available to exchange into, exchanges will no longer be available once a game reaches a specific ticketing threshold. Once a game is nearing that threshold, the Pirates will notify you via email that exchanges are nearing capacity, thus giving you an opportunity to transact your potential exchange before the game is closed.
STH Exchange Ticket Rate is subject to change throughout the 2024 Season.
Digital Parking Passes may be exchanged for 2024 game dates
*Excluding Opening Day.	**Please note account must be in good standing in order to participate in future game exchanges

SEASON TICKET TERMS AND CONDITIONS
SEASON TICKET AGREEMENT
This Season Ticket Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into between the purchaser of season tickets (“Account Holder”) and Pittsburgh Associates (the “Pirates”).
In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FEATURE. YOU WILL BE CHARGED, AND PAYMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROCESSED, FOR SEASON TICKETS ANNUALLY UNTIL YOU OPT-OUT. YOU WILL BE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT-OUT ANNUALLY DURING AN OPT-OUT PERIOD, WHICH WILL BE SPECIFIED IN THE APPLICABLE SEASON’S NOTICE OF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL, WHICH WILL BE SENT TO YOU PRIOR TO THE START OF EACH SEASON. PLEASE SEE SECTION 4 FOR DETAILS.
THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDES AN ARBITRATION PROVISION WITH A CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. THE ARBITRATION PROVISION MAY HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE WAY IN WHICH YOU OR THE PIRATES RESOLVE ANY CLAIM.
1. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
a.              Account Holder hereby agrees to purchase a season ticket package, which shall consist of tickets to a designated number of individual Pirates games. Each individual game ticket is a limited, revocable license issued by the Pirates to attend the baseball game listed on the applicable ticket.
b.              The “Account” is the revocable license granted by this Agreement to purchase the tickets specified in the Account Holder’s personalized URL for the price set forth in the Account Holder’s personalized URL. All Account sales are final and no refunds or exchanges will be made, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. The Pirates reserve the right to set a limit on how many season tickets an Account Holder may purchase.
c.              The terms and conditions applicable to the Account include those provided:
i.               in this Agreement;
ii.             on each individual game ticket;
iii.            on the Pirates website at	www.pirates.com	(including, without limitation, the Guest Conduct standards posted online at	www.pirates.com/a-z)	;
iv.            on any signage in PNC Park; and
v.              orally or in writing by authorized team or stadium personnel,
each of which are incorporated by reference in this Agreement.
d.              The Pirates reserve the right to amend or supplement the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement at any time. The Pirates may amend or supplement this Agreement either by providing written notice to Account Holder or by posting information about and/or amendments or supplements to the terms and conditions online at	www.pirates.com.	It is the responsibility of Account Holder to read and comply with all updated terms and conditions at all times. The Pirates are not responsible for problems, losses or inconveniences experienced because Account Holder did not read information regarding the Account or this Agreement or because the information was mailed to a former or incorrect physical or e-mail address.
e.              Accounts are not transferrable. This Agreement, the Account, and any rights Account Holder may have hereunder shall not be assigned or transferred in any manner, whether voluntarily or by gift, bequest, or operation of law, by Account Holder to any other person or entity without express written consent from the Pirates. Only Account Holder of record is allowed to make any changes to the Account. The Pirates reserve the right to require Account Holder to provide proof of identity and authorization to act before making any Account changes. It is the responsibility of Account Holder to notify the Pirates of any changes in Account Holder’s contact information.
f.               The Pirates may provide an electronic ticket transfer system (the “System”). Any and all use of the System is subject to the terms and conditions associated with the Account and with accessing the System. The Pirates reserve the right to suspend, modify, replace and/or cancel the System at any time in their sole discretion. The Pirates reserve the right to disengage Account Holder’s access to electronically post for sale and forward tickets or revoke Account Holder’s Account if the Account and/or System terms and conditions are violated.
g.              Account Holder agrees that it is a material breach of this Agreement for Account Holder to (or attempt to) sell, trade, forward, or otherwise transfer more than 50% of the tickets purchased through their Account without the express written consent of the Pirates.
h.              Absent express written consent from the Pirates, the Account and tickets obtained by Account Holder shall not be used for advertising, promotion (including contests and sweepstakes), or other trade or commercial purposes.
i.               Season ticket plans do not confer any ownership or leasehold rights on Account Holder. Season ticket plans are offered on a single-season basis only. The purchase of season tickets for the current season does not entitle Account Holder to purchase season tickets or to have tickets for a particular seat or seating area in any subsequent season. Season ticket sales in future seasons are subject to any changes, limitations and/or deadlines that have been or may be imposed by the Pirates. In particular, the Pirates expressly reserve the right to:
i.               change season ticket policies and prices at any time and for any reason;
ii.             apply components of season ticket purchases, such as policies, prices, or Benefits, differently to different persons or entities, including, without limitation, persons who are engaged in reselling tickets (whether licensed to do so or not);
iii.            charge an administrative fee in connection with any reissuance of tickets that are lost or stolen or any approved correction or change to Account information; or
iv.            refuse to sell future season tickets to any individual or entity, including, but not limited to, individuals or entities who:
A.            fail to comply with any applicable payment deadline or other condition or restriction;
B.             resell tickets to third parties (whether licensed to do so or not); or
C.             engage in, or permit the use of their tickets by any person who engages in, conduct prohibited by team or stadium policies, including, without limitation, the Guest Conduct standards posted online	www.pirates.com/a-z.
j.               If the Pirates are authorized by Major League Baseball to issue Post-Season tickets, Account Holder may be entitled to purchase one (1) ticket for every possible Post-Season game for each seat held in the Account. Account Holder may not resell any Post-Season tickets for a premium in excess of any amount allowed by federal, state or local law. If Account Holder sells or offers to sell any Post-Season tickets at or near PNC Park, he or she will be removed from the premises and prosecuted, and could lose future rights to purchase tickets from the Pirates. Post-Season tickets may be subject to additional terms and conditions. The Pirates reserve the right to offer Account Holder relocated seats for Post-Season games. To the extent that any Post-Season games purchased by an Account Holder are not played, Account Holder may be offered the opportunity to seek a refund of amounts paid for unplayed Post-Season games, less any applicable service charges or fees, or to request that amounts paid for unplayed Post-Season games be applied to future ticket charges. In the event that Account Holder opts to have such amounts applied to future ticket charges, however, such decision does not automatically confer any right on Account Holder to purchase tickets in the future, including, without limitation, season tickets. The Pirates reserve the right to refund any amounts paid for unplayed Post-Season games to Account Holder, without interest or damages of any kind, in the event that the Pirates determine, in their sole discretion, not to grant Account Holder a license to purchase tickets in the future.
k.              Certain Account Holders may be eligible to receive benefits, experiences and discounts (“Benefits”) in addition to their game tickets at no additional charge. The Pirates have sole discretion to determine which Account Holders qualify for such Benefits. Benefits may be modified, revoked, or terminated by the Pirates, as to an individual Account Holder or all Account Holders, at any time and for any reason, without compensation or damages of any kind. Account Holders that sell, trade, forward, or otherwise transfer more than 50% of the tickets purchased through their Account may not be eligible for any Benefits.
l.               The Pirates are not responsible for lost tickets, stolen tickets, or tickets left at another location.

LECOM PARK
Located in Bradenton, Florida, approximately 50 miles south of Tampa, LECOM Park is the Spring Training ballpark of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
ABOUT LECOM PARK
LECOM Park was originally built in 1923. It has undergone a number of significant renovations over the last three decades to provide fans modern amenities while maintaining the feeling of a classic ballpark. The iconic Spanish mission style façade was constructed during a significant facelift of the stadium in the early 1990s. Lights came about in 2008.	The centerpiece of the renovations came in 2013 when the Pirates, the City of Bradenton, and Manatee County partnered on a $10 million renovation of fan areas which included a 19,000 square foot boardwalk spanning the outfield. Updates also included new group areas with enhanced sight lines to the field, expanded restroom facilities, new concessions locations and an enlarged Fan Plaza. Massive palm trees now dot the landscape, augmenting the charm of the 90-year-old stadium. Every individual reserved seat was removed from the park, and 4,600 new, more comfortable seats were installed. And new covered bleachers with 570 seats were added in left field, expanding LECOM Park's capacity to more than 8,500. In addition, a new state-of-the-art clubhouse and office building was built in 2015, giving the Pirates one of the best spring training facilities in the Grapefruit League.	"The rebuilding project at LECOM Park speaks to the strength of our partnership with Bradenton and Manatee County," said Pirates Chairman of the Board Bob Nutting. "It is a partnership of that, I believe, is the strongest in Major League Baseball thanks to the local leadership of Mayor Poston, the City Council, the County Commission, Tourist Development Council, Bradenton Downtown Development Authority and, most importantly, the support of the Bradenton community."	LECOM Park, which is also home to the Bradenton Marauders of the Florida State League, received the top honor of the 2018 Best of the Ballparks fan vote for High-A facilities, conducted by Ballpark Digest. The same publication has previously recognized The Friendly City's ballfield as "Best of the Ballparks" in the Grapefruit League. LECOM Park has held the top spot among Florida Spring Training destinations since 2016.	"Tradition means a lot in the Grapefruit League and spring training, and LECOM Park is certainly one of the most traditional venues in all of baseball," said Kevin Reichard, publisher of Ballpark Digest and Spring Training Online. "With some great updates in recent years that really enhanced the fan experience, LECOM Park really is best of both worlds."	LECOM Park renovations from 1991-93 included new grounds, wide access ramps, concession stands, kiosks and improved sight lines, all while maintaining a ballpark's classic ambiance. The palm-tree lined park was integrated into the already 1920s Spanish-mission style by using masonry, stucco and structural steel materials. LECOM Park was even pulled back from the street, allowing for the creation of a public plaza and walkway around the park. Inside McKechnie, fans moved closer to the field by expanding seating capacity from approximately 4,200 seats to more than 6,500 seats.	The ballpark was originally named McKechnie Field, in honor of Pittsburgh native, former Bradenton resident and Hall of Fame manager Bill McKechnie. The new name, LECOM Park, was announced on February 10, 2017.
About LECOM	Founded in 1992, the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) has grown to become the largest medical school in the country.

A unique link, which holds the key to your ticket, will be generated and you can distribute it as you see fit. Please only share this link with one person to whom you are forwarding your ticket. If you share the link with multiple recipients, whomever clicks that link and completes the "forward accept" process first will get that ticket.
What if I accidentally send the ticket to the wrong email address?
You can easily cancel a ticket forward that is in a pending state directly from your list of tickets inside the Wallet. You can then resend the ticket to the correct email address.
How will my recipient know I forwarded tickets?
Both you and the recipient will receive an email that notifies that the ticket forward has been initiated. The recipient will have a unique link in the email to accept the ticket. If you selected "Share Link," the recipient will receive the notification by whatever method you selected for delivering the link.
How do I accept a ticket forward?
You must click "Accept" from the email invitation you received. If you do not already have the MLB Ballpark app on your supported iOS or Android device, you will be prompted to download the app.
I do not have a supported iOS or Android device. Can I still accept a ticket forward?
Yes, you can accept and receive your tickets in a standard web browser. Once a ticket forward has been accepted, contact us at 941-747-3031 and	[email protected]	or	[email protected]	.
What if the email address where I received the ticket forward is not the same as the email address associated with my MLB account?
The email address at which you received your tickets does not need to match the email address associated with your MLB account, but you will be required to click the link in the email where the ticket was forwarded to.
Can I reject a ticket forward?
Yes, just click, "I do not want to accept this ticket" on the Ticket Accept webpage. This webpage is accessible only from the ticket forward email sent to the recipient. The sender of the ticket forward will be informed that the invitation was rejected and will continue to have access to the ticket in their MLB Ballpark app
If I receive a forwarded ticket, can I re-forward that ticket to another recipient?
Yes, a ticket can be forwarded again. Each time a ticket is forwarded, the two participants, the sender and the recipient, will receive a notification of this transaction
Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward?
Yes, the sender can cancel a ticket forward any time before the barcode has been scanned. This can be accomplished from the Wallet tab by selecting an individual ticket and tapping "Cancel" or by clicking on the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. Select the specific Forward then tap "Cancel Forward." The recipient of the ticket you forwarded will be notified.
Can I cancel or recall a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted?
Yes, the original ticket sender can cancel or recall a ticket forward after it has been accepted. The sender and recipient will be notified by email of this action and the ticket will disappear from the recipient's (or anyone they may have forwarded it to) Wallet tab. However, once the ticket has been scanned for entry, the ticket cannot be recalled.
Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted and re-sent?
Yes, the original ticket owner can cancel the forward for a ticket to a Pirates home game regardless of how many times it has been re-forwarded as long as it has not been scanned for entry yet. The sender and original recipient will be notified by email of this action, and the ticket will disappear from the Wallet Tab and/or My Pirates Tickets account of whomever the ticket had last been forwarded to.
Can I forward multiple Pirates tickets to a single account?
Yes. Tickets can be forwarded together from the same event or one ticket at a time.
Where can I find the status of all Pirates Ticket Forwards?
You can navigate to the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. There, you will find all received and sent ticket forwards for your account.
What if I never received the Ticket Forward email?
If you are expecting to receive a ticket forward but were never notified by email, contact the sender. The sender can cancel the current Ticket Forward then re-send to you by email or share link. If you or the sender are still having difficulties, contact us at 941-747-3031 and	[email protected]	or	[email protected]	.
If the person I forward tickets to deletes the email they received to accept the ticket(s) before they click "Accept," what should I do?
The ticket owner should cancel their original ticket forward and then re-forward the ticket via the MLB Ballpark app so the recipient receives a new email through which to accept the ticket(s).
