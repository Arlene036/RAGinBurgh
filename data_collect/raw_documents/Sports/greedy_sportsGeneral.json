Progressing up the stadium facade, the building gradually changes from steel and stone into walls of glass which reflect downtown skyscrapers such as PPG Place and Fifth Avenue Place, both of which are visible from inside the stadium. The 7,100 club seats tucked between the two levels on both sides of Acrisure Stadium offer a fantastic vantage point and access to the two three-story club lounges. These popular lounges feature a wall of glass from floor to ceiling for nearly the entire length of the building.",

It is a classic-style ballpark, an intimate facility that embraces the progressiveness of Pittsburgh while saluting the spirit of early ballpark originals such as Forbes Field, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. This riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks-rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field-with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort. Its prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the Downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. PNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also oriented to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond."

The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh. PNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line.
