        "The Pittsburgh Pirates are an American professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh. The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division. Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants, nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game.\n",
        "The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente, the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell.\n",
        "Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012, a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues.[5]\nThe Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League,[6] and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,839\u201310,819\u2013140 (.500 winning 'percentage').[7]\n",
        "The Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from buccaneer, a synonym for pirate). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park, a 39,000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side. The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the flag of Pittsburgh and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Steelers and the Penguins.\n",
        "Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club, an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season.[8] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,[9] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh,[10] the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (rarely the \"Alleghenies\") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887.[11]\n",
        "\nBefore the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League's Pittsburgh Burghers. The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer, who had previously played with the A.A.'s Philadelphia Athletics. Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\".[12] This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers.[13] The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. ",
        "After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels, who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.)[14] Among those players was Honus Wagner, who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played, which they lost to Boston. The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909, defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field.\n",
        "As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler, along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925, becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series.[15] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees. The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season.\n",
        "Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960. They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees, yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2022, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history.\n",
        "Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente, the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971. Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium, the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass. In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup.[16]\nDespite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975, and 1979. Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, and Al Oliver, the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song \"We Are Family\" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3\u20131 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis).\n",
        "The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, and Doug Drabek. The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992. Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season.\n",
        "With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park, did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen, defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game. They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals. That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins.[17] On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th[18] making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs.[19] The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then.\n",
        "Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park, located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium, a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics.[20] Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services.[21] PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game, when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4\u20130.\n",
        "Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel fa\u00e7ade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline.[22][23][24][25] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953;[26] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher,[27] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente, who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell, Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts.\n",
        "PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge, or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station, located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance.\n",
        "The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park, located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park, which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season.[28] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920.[29] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series.\n",
        "In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland, which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation.[30] Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss \"hated cheap home runs and vowed he'd have none in his park\", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field.[31] When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected.[32][33][34] Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of Babe Ruth's career on May 25, 1935[35] and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series. The park also hosted football games for the Pittsburgh Steelers and University of Pittsburgh \"Pitt\" Panthers. Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall.[36][37]\n",
        "The Pirates moved into the multipurpose Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like other multi-purpose stadiums popular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and Stage AE, although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near Acrisure Stadium. In 2012, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the home plate and first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3,000th hit.[38]\n",
        "Since 1969, the Pirates have held Spring Training at LECOM Park in Bradenton, Florida, which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, the Bradenton Marauders. Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind only Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach, which dates to 1914.[39] It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after Fenway Park, built in 1912, and Wrigley Field, built in 1914.[40] Built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights.[41] The park was formerly named \"McKechnie Field,\" for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great Bill McKechnie, who led the Pirates in 1925; since 2017 it has been named for the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, which has its main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania, and also a campus in Bradenton.[42] Pirate City, the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park.\n",
        "The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the \"P\" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century.[43] During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple \"P\" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had \"Pirates\" running vertically down the placket.[43] The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and \"Pittsburgh\" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942.[43]\n",
        "In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic \"Red, White, & Blue\" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League. The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924,[44][45][46] but the change did not last beyond that season.[47][48] Along with the San Francisco Giants, the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an \"accent color\" in 1997 and remained until 2009.\n",
        "In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit).[43] The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.\n",
        "In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes. After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons.[43] The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys, following the Oakland Athletics. Starting in 1977, the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the 1979 World Series. The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold \"P\" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since.[43]\n",
        "After Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009, the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold \"P\" at both home and on the road.[43] From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019.[49]\n",
        "Since the 2015 season, the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games.[50] The camouflage alternates were updated for the 2018 season, now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches.[51]\n",
        "Ahead of the 2020 season, the Pirates revived the script \"Pittsburgh\" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the \"P\" logo outlined in black and yellow.[52] In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold \"P\", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park.\n",
        "In 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new \"4+1\" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a City Connect uniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold \"P\" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh \"PGH\". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements. The inverted \"Y\", representing the three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh (Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio). The astroid, or the diamond shape star represents the famous \"Steelmark\" logo and the Check or the Checkbox, represents the Seal of Pittsburgh.[53]\n",
        "The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League until 1994.[54][55][56] It began when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies.[57]\n",
        "The Phillies and the Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969\u20131993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s.[56][58][59] The Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.[58]\n",
        "After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished.[55][56] However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fueling the rivalry.[60]\n",
        "The Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the Cincinnati Reds, given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities' football rivalry, and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason,[61] most recently in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. In the 2010s, the two teams frequently hit each other with pitches, occasionally resulting in brawls.[62]\n",
        "From 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the St. Louis Cardinals for the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the 2013 National League Division Series, which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious[63] battle with the Milwaukee Brewers for a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game. The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of \nthe 1938 season.\n",
        "The Pirates play an annual interleague series against the Detroit Tigers. While the Pirates and Tigers only became \"natural rivals\" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins. The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986\u20131996) and the Tigers (2005\u20132013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36\u201329. The two teams played in the 1909 World Series.\n",
        "An on-and-off rivalry with the Cleveland Guardians stems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football League between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically.  The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new \"balanced\" schedule.  The Pirates lead the series 21\u201318.[64]\n",

        "In 2022, the Pirates formally established a team Hall of Fame to honor the \"most influential ballplayers in Pittsburgh baseball history\", as picked by an internal committee that had the help of team historian Jim Trdinich.[65][66] 19 individuals were part of the first class, which included every Pittsburgh Pirate inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame along with several other former players, broadcasters, and coaches. Like the Washington Nationals with the Ring of Honor, the Pirates inducted players that had played for the Negro league baseball team Homestead Grays, which had played in Forbes Field and Greenlee Field in Pittsburgh alongside their time in Washington; two of the first class also spent time with the Pittsburgh Crawfords, with a ceremony dedicated to \"signing\" the four to Pirates contracts. All inductees were honored with a plaque displayed in the concourse by the entrance with the statue of Roberto Clemente.[67][68]\n",

        "The Pirates organization was the first in baseball to have both an African-American coach and manager, when Gene Baker broke the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively. On September 21, 1963, the Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African-American manager in Gene Baker, as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh.[105]\n",
        "On September 1, 1971, manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed of minority players for the first time in MLB history.[106]\n",
        "Even though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby, Michael Keaton, and Regis Philbin,[107] the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams.[108] However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in 2013, the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century.\n",
        "While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s,[109] the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.[110] The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001.[111] Following the Andrew McCutchen trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner Robert Nutting, with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season.[112]\n",
        "When the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain Sidney Crosby brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in Detroit. When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home Three Rivers Stadium.\n",
        "Each year, the Pirates recognize six \"Community Champions\" during a special pregame ceremony.[113]\n",
        "Piratefest is a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates in January. The event is, in essence, a baseball carnival for the whole family. It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players and coaches, live events and games, carnival booths, baseball clinics, \"Ask Pirates Management\", and appearances by the Pirate Parrot. Piratefest was once held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh[114] but is now held annually at the ballpark.\n",
        "The Pirates broadcast the first ever baseball game over the radio on August 5, 1921. Harold Arlin, a foreman at Westinghouse, announced the game over KDKA from a box seat next to the first base dugout at Forbes Field.[115][116] KDKA had received its broadcasting license only nine months before, becoming the first commercially licensed radio station in the world. Pirate games would be sporadically broadcast over the radio for the next decade; regular broadcasts began in the mid-1930s, with Rosey Rowswell becoming the voice of the Pirates in 1936.[117] Except for a few years on WWSW in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years. KDKA's 50,000-watt clear channel enabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games.\n",
        "In 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports and moved to FM talk radio station WPGB. The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25\u201354 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that Clear Channel Communications holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states. Stations for the 2007 season included Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters.[118]\n",
        "On October 1, 2011, Clear Channel announced that they would not renew their deal with the Pirates, and the team shortly thereafter announced a deal to transfer back to CBS Radio via FM sports radio station KDKA-FM,[119] which became official on October 12.[120]\nOn March 2, 2016, it was announced a new deal was reached for the Pirates to remain on KDKA-FM.[121] As part of the deal, KDKA-AM has returned as essentially the AM flagship of the team, simulcasting all weekday afternoon games, select other broadcasts, and serving as the backup station for any games that KDKA-FM can not air due to conflicts with Pittsburgh Panthers football and men's basketball.[122]\n",
        "Games are televised on SportsNet Pittsburgh, the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, when it was known as KBL. The network is majority owned by Fenway Sports Group, owners of the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Penguins. The Pirates became joint owners of the channel on December 16, 2023, with operations to be produced by the Red Sox's home network NESN.[123] During the 2016 season, the Pirates averaged a 7.22 rating and 83,000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts.[124] Apart from any Pirates games aired nationally on Fox, there has been no over-the-air coverage of the Pirates since 2002. Previously, KDKA-TV aired Pirates games for 38 years (1957\u20131994). Games also aired on WPXI (1995\u20131996) and on WPGH-TV and WCWB (1997\u20132002).\n",
        "Current\n",
        "The Pirates have no set broadcast team for radio or TV; instead, all announcers and analysts take turns working in both mediums over the course of a season. The longest-tenured broadcasters are play-by-play announcer Greg Brown and analyst Bob Walk, both of whom joined the broadcast booth in 1994. Former Pirate and Pittsburgh native John Wehner joined the crew in 2005 as an analyst,[125] while Joe Block became the team's second play-by-play announcer in 2016 after previously working for the Milwaukee Brewers.[126] Former Pirate players who have recently filled in as analysts include Matt Capps, Kevin Young, and Neil Walker.\n",
        "Past\n",
        "Westinghouse Electric foreman Harold Arlin called the first-ever radio broadcast of a baseball game, an 8-5 Phillies victory over the Pirates on August 5, 1921. A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the teleprinter, usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by Bob Prince in 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955.[127] Prince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team.[128][129] Nicknamed \"The Gunner,\" Prince was known for his \"Gunnerisms\"\u2014nicknames and quips\u2014and created the Green Weenie in 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in 1960 and 1971 as part of the national broadcast for NBC.\n",
        "Prince and his broadcast partner Nellie King were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. Milo Hamilton and Lanny Frattare took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince.[130] Hamilton left to join the Chicago Cubs after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by Tim Neverett, who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015.[131]\n",
        "Former analysts include Don Hoak, Nelson Briles, and Jim Rooker. Former Pirate pitcher Steve Blass, who won Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, worked as a color analyst for the team from 1983 to 2019.[132]\n"

        "The early years": [
            "The Pirates' roots in Pittsburgh actually date back to April 15, 1876, when the Pittsburgh Alleghenys brought professional baseball to the city by playing their first game at Union Park. In 1877, the Alleghenys were accepted into the minor-league International Association, but disbanded the following year.",
            "Baseball returned to Pittsburgh for good in 1882 when the Alleghenys reformed and joined the American Association, a rival of the National League. After the 1886 season, the Kansas City franchise was expelled from the N.L. and Pittsburgh President William A. Nimmick's application for membership was accepted.",
            "On April 30, 1887, the Alleghenys defeated the defending league-champion Chicago White Stockings, 6-2, before a crowd of nearly 10,000 at Recreation Park. The victorious beginning was not an indication of things to come, however, as the team managed to finish higher than fifth only once in the 13 remaining seasons of the century. In 1890, the Alleghenys' roster was demolished when key players jumped to a new rival to the National League - the Players League. They staggered to a club-record 113 losses as the two leagues engaged in a bitter battle over talent.",
            "When the Players League folded after only one season, all players were expected to return to the clubs they played for in 1889. But in 1891 Pittsburgh signed Louis Bierbauer, a second baseman with Brooklyn of the Players League who had spent the previous four seasons with the Philadelphia Athletics. The A's and their American Association brethren immediately accused Pittsburgh of \"pirating\" Bierbauer away from them. Pittsburgh kept the player and the nickname and became known as the Pirates thereafter.",
            "The fortunes of the Pirates turned in 1900 when the National League reduced its membership from 12 to eight teams. As part of the move, Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the defunct Louisville club, acquired controlling interest of the Pirates. In the largest player transaction in Pirates history, the Hall-of-Fame owner brought 14 players with him from the Louisville roster, including Hall of Famers Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke and Rube Waddell - plus standouts Deacon Phillippe, Chief Zimmer, Claude Ritchey and Tommy Leach. All would play significant roles as the Pirates became the league's dominant franchise, winning pennants in 1901, 1902 and 1903 and a World championship in 1909.",
            "Wagner, dubbed \"The Flying Dutchman,\" was the game's premier player during the decade, winning seven batting titles and leading the majors in hits (1,850) and RBI (956) from 1900-1909. One of the pioneers of the game, Dreyfuss is sometimes called \"The Father of the World Series\" because he challenged Henry Killilea, the owner of the American League champion Boston Americans, to a post-season playoff in 1903 to determine who was baseball's best team. On October 1, 1903, Phillippe defeated the legendary Cy Young, 7-3, in the first World Series game ever played. Boston, however, later emerged as the Series winner, overcoming a three-games-to- one deficit to win the best-of-nine competition, five games to three. In the Series, Phillippe started five of the games.",
            "The Pirates finished as runner-up three times in the next five years before getting another shot at a World Series title in 1909. The Bucs won a club-record 110 games that year with three pitchers - Howie Camnitz (25), Vic Willis (22) and Lefty Leifield (19) combining for 66 victories. The Series pitted the league's batting champions - Wagner and Detroit's Ty Cobb against each other, but rookie pitcher Babe Adams, who was 12-3 during the regular season, emerged as the Series hero for the Pirates.",
            "While Camnitz, Willis and Leifield failed to win a game, Adams won three, including a six-hit shutout in the seventh and deciding game. It was the last of four titles the Pirates would win under Clarke, who managed the club until 1915."
        ],
        "THE FORBES FIELD YEARS": [
            "The 1909 season also marked the beginning of a new era in ballparks as the Pirates christened Forbes Field on June 30 that year. Since 1891, the Pirates had called Exposition Park - which was located on virtually the same site as Three Rivers Stadium - their home. Described as the \"Hialeah of Ballparks\" when it opened, Forbes Field would remain the home of the Pirates for six decades and would host many great moments.",
            "Pittsburgh sank to the league's second division for most of the next decade, but by the early 1920's - with an influx of outstanding talent which included future Hall of Famers Pie Traynor, Kiki Cuyler, Rabbit Maranville and Max Carey - Pittsburgh was again a contender. After three straight third- place finishes from 1922 to 1924, the Pirates won the N.L. title by eight and a half games over the second-place New York Giants in 1925.",
            "The Series matched Pittsburgh against the Washington Senators, who jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead. The Pirates, however, bounced back to win the final three games and the Series. Their miraculous comeback included a 15-hit pounding of Hall of Famer Walter \"Big Train\" Johnson in Game Seven.",
            "In 1926, a rookie named Paul Waner joined the Bucs and batted .336. A year later, his brother Lloyd joined him and belted out 223 hits for a club rookie record .355 average and the Pirates were again National League champions. Paul, who was nicknamed \"Big Poison\" - batted .300 or better 14 times, captured three batting titles and collected 200 or more hits in eight different seasons. He was named the league's Most Valuable Player in 1927 and went on to compile 3,152 hits and a .333 career batting average. Lloyd - who was tagged \"Little Poison\" - hit .300 or better in 10 of his first 12 seasons, compiled a career mark of .316 and accumulated 2,450 hits. Both were elected to the Hall of Fame.",
            "The 1927 World Series featured the Pirates against New York's famed \"Murderer's Row\" with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, who swept Pittsburgh in four straight games. The next 33 years, Pirate fans went without a pennant winner, although they were not denied their share of great players and great moments.",
            "The Waners were consistently among baseball's premier hitters during the 1930's with Paul amassing more hits (1,959) during the decade than any player in baseball. Traynor was one of the era's best all-around players and is generally regarded as one of the finest third basemen ever to play the game. Shortstop Arky Vaughan topped the .300-mark in each of his 10 seasons with the Pirates (1932-1941) and his .385 average in 1935 has gone unequalled by any National League performer. He, too, is enshrined at Cooperstown.",
            "Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner won or shared the N.L. home run title in each of the seven seasons that he wore a Pirates uniform (1946-52) - which is a streak that has never been matched in either league. In 1956, Pirate first baseman Dale Long hit home runs in a record eight straight games between May 19th and May 28th (that mark was matched by Don Mattingly in 1987 and Ken Griffey Jr. in 1993). Three years later, Harvey Haddix hurled what many consider the greatest game ever pitched when he retired 36 straight Milwaukee Braves hitters over 12 innings on May 26, 1959. The same year, ElRoy Face won 17 straight games in relief.",
            "Though the Pirates failed to finish higher than seventh from 1950 through 1957, the foundation for another championship was being put into place. Standout players were added throughout the decade, including 2001 Hall-of-Fame inductee Bill Mazeroski, Dick Groat, Vernon Law, Bob Friend, Bill Virdon, Face and Hall-of-Fame right fielder Roberto Clemente.",
            "In 1956, Pirate owner John Galbreath hired Joe L. Brown as general manager. With the club languishing in last place at 36-67 midway through the 1957 campaign, Brown promoted coach Danny Murtaugh to field manager. Within three seasons, the Bucs were again champions of the National League and again matched against the powerful New York Yankees in the World Series. This time the Bronx Bombers featured Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.",
            "The 1960 World Series remains one of the most incredible post-season encounters ever on record. The Yankees won Game Two, Game Three and Game Six by a combined score of 38-3, but the Pirates used great pitching, defense and timely hitting to stretch the Series to a seventh game at Forbes Field. Pittsburgh took a 9-7 lead into the ninth - thanks to Hal Smith's three-run homer in the eighth - but the Yankees came up with two runs in the top of the ninth to tie the score. The game and the Series ended, however, in the bottom of the ninth as Mazeroski belted what is perhaps the most dramatic home run in baseball history off Ralph Terry. Mazeroski was the only player in baseball history ever to end a World Series with a home run until Joe Carter of Toronto accomplished the feat in Game Six of the 1993 Fall Classic.",
            "During the 1960's, Clemente established himself among the game's elite players. He collected more hits (1,877) than anyone during the decade and would go on to reach the 3,000-hit plateau in 1972. During his marvelous career, he topped the .300 mark 13 times, won four batting titles and was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1966."

        "THE THREE RIVERS STADIUM YEARS": [
            "The changing of the decade also brought along a change to the home ballpark of the Pirates. After playing in cavernous Forbes Field since June 30, 1909, the Bucs began play at a multi-purpose stadium located at the confluence of Pittsburgh's three rivers. The aptly named Three Rivers Stadium played host to its first game on July 16, 1970, with the Pirates losing a 3-2 decision to the Reds.",
            "During the 1970's, the Pirates were again among baseball's premier teams. In that 10-year span, they won six division titles and finished as low as third only once. In the first 25 years of divisional play, the Bucs won more games (2,100) and finished first more often (nine times) than any other N.L. East club. The Pirates put together a 2,100-1,878 record during that period (.528 winning %).",
            "The Pirates captured two more World Championships during the 1970's. Their 1971 victory over Baltimore was a showcase for Clemente, who batted .414 and received the Series MVP award.",
            "In 1979, the Pirates became only the fourth team in history to erase a three-games-to-one deficit when they again bested the Orioles in seven games. Hall of Famer Willie Stargell took home MVP honors - as he did during the regular season - with a .400 batting average, three home runs (including the Series' deciding blow in Game Seven) and seven RBI. It was a fitting conclusion to the decade for Stargell, who was the leading home run hitter of the 1970's (296). While the Pirates brought two world championships back to Pittsburgh during the 1970s, the Pittsburgh Steelers also came to prominence. The Steelers won four Super Bowls during the 70s, which, coupled with the Pirates success, helped garner Pittsburgh the \"City of Champions\" label.",
            "On October 2, 1985, the Galbreath family and Warner Communications sold the club to Pittsburgh Associates; a group of private investors who were committed to keeping the team in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Associates was made up of 10 investors representing",
            "six corporations, three individuals and Carnegie Mellon Univer- sity. The group included the Aluminum Company of America, Mellon Bank, PNC Financial Corporation, PPG Industries, USX Corporation, Westinghouse Electric Company, Eugene and Raymond Litman, John McConnell and Harvey M. Walken.",
            "After several lean years in the mid-eighties, the Pirates returned to contention in 1988 when they finished in second place and broke the club's 28-year-old attendance mark.",
            "With players like Barry Bonds, Doug Drabek, Bobby Bonilla and Andy Van Slyke, Pittsburgh started the decade of the 1990's in fine fashion, winning the N.L. East title three straight years. The Bucs became the first team to win three straight division titles since the Philadelphia Phillies accomplished the feat between 1976 and 1978. Bonds captured MVP honors in 1990 and 1992, while Drabek won the Cy Young award in '90. Manager Jim Leyland took home N.L. Manager-of-the-Year honors in both 1990 and 1992. In his 11 seasons at the helm, Leyland won 849 games, placing him third on the club's All-Time Managerial win list.",
            "Pittsburgh was on the brink of a World Series berth in both the 1991 and 1992 season, but the Pirates lost the seventh and deciding game each year to the Atlanta Braves. In 1992, Pittsburgh came within three outs of the Fall Classic. But in the bottom of the ninth inning at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, the Braves triumphed with three runs and won the game 3-2 and the series, four-games-to-three.",
            "The people of Pittsburgh and the surrounding Tri-State area responded well to the club's success in the nineties as the Pirates drew in excess of two million fans in both 1990 and 1991.",
            "A crowd of 59,568, the largest ever to watch a professional baseball game in Pittsburgh, witnessed the 65th Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12, 1994. In one of the most thrilling All-Star Games ever to be played, the National League prevailed over the American League in extra frames. Fred McGriff helped send the game into extra innings when he delivered a two-run, pinch- hit home run off Lee Smith in the bottom of the ninth inning that tied the score. After the American League failed to score in the top of the 10th inning, the National League broke its six-game losing streak when Tony Gwynn scored on a double by Moises Alou.",

            "Picked by many publications to finish last in 1997, the Pirates remained in the division race until the final weekend of the season and the club was named USA Today's \"Organization of the Year\" at the conclusion of the season. Major League Baseball also",
            "underwent a change in 1997 with the birth of Interleague play. That season, the Pirates welcomed the Kansas City Royals to Three Rivers Stadium on June 13 for the club's first interleague matchup, which Pittsburgh won by a score of 5-3.",
            "While the Bucs contended for the division during the entire 1997 season, one of the most memorable moments of the season came on July 12. That night, pitchers Francisco Cordova and Ricardo Rincon thrilled Pirates fans with the only combined, extra-inning no-hitter in major league history. The game ended in the bottom of the 10th inning when Mark Smith delivered a three-run home run for the 3-0 win.",
            "The 2000 season brought an end to a full century of great moments, a 100-year period which began with three straight National League pennants and ended with an aura of hope and dreams of more championships to come. With a new home on the horizon, the Bucs said goodbye to Three Rivers Stadium with their final game ever played there on October 1, 2000. Three no-hitters, Clemente's 3000th hit, two All-Star Games, countless playoff games, two World Championships and endless summer evenings can be associated with no other place in the history of Pittsburgh than Three Rivers Stadium.",

Pittsburgh native John Wehner smacked the final home run in the history of the ballpark off Chicago's Jon Lieber. Ironically, Wehner also grounded out to third base for the final out ever at Three Rivers. With the loss, Pittsburgh closed out Three Rivers Stadium with a record of 1,324 wins and 1,082 losses.",

            "PNC Park officially opened its gates on April 9, 2001. Regarded by many as the best ballpark ever built, PNC Park is an intimate two-level structure which offers all fans dramatic views of the downtown skyline as well as the natural grass playing surface. After touring all 30 major league ballparks during the summer of 2003, ESPN.com ranked PNC Park as the best in baseball.",
          
            "The anticipation and joy of a new ballpark turned to sorrow, when on the morning of the first regular season game at PNC Park, a beloved member of the Pirates family was lost when Willie Stargell passed away on April 9, 2001.",
          
            "Despite suffering 100 losses for just the seventh time in club history in 2001, fans came out in record numbers as the Bucs played in front of 19 sellouts and a total of 2,436,139 customers during the inaugural season at PNC Park.",
           
            "On June 25, 2002, the Pirates registered the 9,000th win in the history of the franchise with a 4-1 victory over the Montreal Expos, thus becoming just the fourth club to produce 9,000 wins.",
        
            "The Pirates have had a long list of sluggers in their history and Brian Giles added his name to that list during his five seasons in a Bucco uniform. He hit 30 or more home runs in each of his first four seasons with the club, just one of three Pirates to hit 30 or more long balls in four consecutive years (also Hall-of-Famers Ralph Kiner and Willie Stargell). His 165 home runs with Pittsburgh rank seventh in club history.",
       
            "Catcher Jason Kendall spent each of his first nine big league seasons in a Pittsburgh uniform after being selected in the first round of the 1992 June draft. In that time, he made 1,205 appearances behind the plate. That figure ranks first all-time in the annals of the club, 50 games ahead of George Gibson, who caught for the Bucs from 1906 thru 1915. Kendall surpassed Gibson's 90-year-old record in Los Angeles on August 3, 2004.",
           
            "For the first time in team history a Pittsburgh player captured Rookie-of-the-Year honors as outfielder Jason Bay took home the honors in 2004. A two-time National League All-Star, Bay was a fan favorite at the 2006 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh.",
       
            "The national spotlight shined once again on the city of Pittsburgh during the 2006 season as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at PNC Park, marking the fifth time the event has been held in the Steel City. The American League won a dramatic 3-2 decision in the Midsummer Classic as the Pirates became the first team in baseball history to host the All-Star Game in three different venues.",
     
            "Also in 2006, Freddy Sanchez added his name to the club's record list of 25 batting champions as his .344 average led the National League. Sanchez banged out 200 hits in 2006 and led the N.L. with 53 doubles while being named to his first of two All-Star teams.",

            "On January 18, 2007, Bob Nutting officially assumed control of the ballclub, thus becoming only the sixth principal owner in the Pirates storied history. Following a deep look into the team's operations, Nutting has built a fundamentally different",
            "organization by introducing Frank Coonelly as the team's new president on September 13, 2007 and, in-turn, Neal Huntington as the team's new general manager on September 25, 2007. From there the new leadership team has made significant changes to each of the three major areas - Major League manager/coaching staff, Scouting Director and Farm Director, with the goal of building an organization that can consistently compete.",
     
            "Since 2009, fans have witnessed the debuts of many first-round draft picks, including Andrew McCutchen, Pedro Alvarez, Neil Walker, Gerrit Cole and Jameson Taillon along with appearances of many other young players, including Starling Marte, Gregory Polanco and Josh Bell.",
  
            "Clint Hurdle was named manager of the Pirates on November 15, 2010, and in his first seven seasons at the helm, the inspirational leader of the club has posted a 584-549-1 record while leading the Bucs to the postseason three times.",
       
            "During the 2012 campaign, Bucco fans showed their great support of the club as the Pirates played host to 17 sellouts during the season.",
      
            "McCutchen also emerged as one of the best players in the game, winning a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger award in 2012 while finishing third in the National League MVP voting.",
    
            "In 2013 the Pirates returned to prominence in the league as they won 94 regular season games and appeared in the postseason for the first time since 1992.",
     
            "The Pirates placed five players on the 2013 All-Star team - the most since also having five selected to the 1972 Midsummer Classic. Along with McCutchen, Pedro Alvarez, Jason Grilli, Jeff Locke and Mark Melancon represented the Bucs at the 2013 All-Star Game, played at Citi Field in New York.",
        
            "Led by 16-game winner and the National League Comeback Player-of-the-Year Francisco Liriano, the Bucco pitching staff posted 16 shutouts in 2013 and ranked third in the N.L. with a 3.26 ERA; the best mark by the pitching staff since 1984. Grilli (33) and Melancon (16) picked up 49 of the club-record and National League leading 55 saves.",
     
            "The offense was led by McCutchen, who took home N.L. MVP honors in 2013 after hitting .317 with 97 runs, 38 doubles, 21 home runs, 84 RBI and 27 stolen bases in 157 games. McCutchen became the sixth player in club history to win the MVP award, joining Dick Groat (1960), Roberto Clemente (1966), Dave Parker (1978), Willie Stargell (1979) and Barry Bonds (1990, 1992).",
      
            "Silver Slugger award winner Pedro Alvarez shared the league lead in home runs in 2013, as the young slugger smacked 36 long balls to become the first Bucco to lead or share the N.L. lead in homers since Willie Stargell did so with 44 in 1973.",
        
            "After winning 94 games during the 2013 regular season and finishing second in the N.L. Central division standings, the Pirates defeated the Reds in the Wild Card playoff game, played before a sold out crowd at PNC Park on October 1. The game would officially launch the kickoff to Buctober for years to come.",
  
            "The Pirates had a two-games-to-one lead in the best of five Division Series playoff against the Cardinals, but dropped the final two games to bring an end to their magical 2013 campaign.",
    
            "The Pirates produced a record 23 sellouts during the 2013 regular season before playing in front of three standing-room only crowds in the postseason.",
  
            "Clint Hurdle also took home some hardware following the 2013 season as he was named the N.L. Manager-of-the Year; just the second Bucco skipper to win the award.",

            "The Pirates reached the postseason again in 2014 while drawing 2,442,564 fans and averaging 30,155 for their 81 home dates. In addition, the Bucs posted 23 regular season sellouts for the second consecutive year.",
       
            "With a combination of the second-best OBP in the National League (.333) and a pitching staff that posted the second- lowest ERA (2.94) over the final two months of the season, the Pirates won 88 games in 2014, finishing 2.0 games behind St. Louis in the Central division race.",
         
            "Josh Harrison finished second in the N.L. batting race while Andrew McCutchen once again put up MVP-type numbers, leading the Pirates to the postseason in back-to-back seasons for just the sixth time in franchise history.",
  
            "The final game of the 2014 season was played on October 1 as a standing-room only crowd of 40,629 watched eventual World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner shut down the Bucs in the Wild Card Game as the Giants began their run toward the championship.",
         
            "For the sixth time in franchise history, and for the first time since 1991, the Pirates won 98 games in a season as the 2015 squad posted a 98-64 record. The Pirates also established a club-record attendance figure in 2015, drawing 2,498,596 fans and averaging 30,847 fans for their 81 home dates. The Bucs went 53-28 at home, setting a record for most wins in a season at PNC Park.",
      
            "During the 2015 campaign, Pittsburgh posted its 10,000th franchise win on September 24, becoming the fifth club to record as many victories.",
      
            "For the third straight year the Pirates hosted the N.L. Wild Card Game in 2015, making the postseason three consecutive years for just the fourth time in team history.",
 
            "Mark Melancon set a club record and led the Major Leagues with 51 saves in 2015. In addition, Gerrit Cole won 19 games, Starling Marte captured a Gold Glove Award for his fielding excellence and Korean import Jung Ho Kang was a finalist for N.L. Rookie- of-the-Year.",
         
            "The 2017 season saw the emergence of another young talented player as Josh Bell set a National League record for most home runs hit by a switch-hitting rookie (26).",
   
            "Bell placed his name in the record books during the 2019 season, putting up one of the best offensive months in MLB history. The N.L. All-Star hit .390 with 12 homers, 31 RBI and a 1.238 OPS in May while setting the club record for most total bases (94) in a month. He also became just the third National League player in history to produce at least 12 doubles and 12 home runs in any calendar month.",
          
            "Derek Shelton was named the 41st manager in team history on November 27, 2019 while Ben Cherington took over General Manager duties - the 13th GM in Pirates history - prior to the 2020 campaign.",
  
            "The 2020 season was shortened to 60 games due to the international COVID-19 pandemic. Travel was also limited as the Pirates played teams only from the N.L. and A.L. Central divisions.",
         
            "For the 50th time in club history, a Gold Glove award was given to a Pirates player as Jacob Stallings took home the hardware for his catching excellence in 2021.",
 
            "A total of 25 rookies appeared in at least one game for the Bucs in 2022 and combined for a club-record 56 home runs, led by Jack Suwinski (19) and Oneil Cruz (17).",

            "In 2023, Mitch Keller set the club record for most strikeouts by a right-handed pitcher (210) while third baseman Ke\u2019Bryan Hayes captured a Gold Glove award - the first won by a Pittsburgh player at that position."
