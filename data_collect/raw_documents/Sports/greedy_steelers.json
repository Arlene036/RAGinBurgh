                    "This season, \"flexible scheduling\" for Sunday Night Football may be used up to twice between Weeks 5-10, and in the NFL's discretion during Weeks 11-17; for Monday Night Football in the NFL's discretion in Weeks 12-17; and for Thursday Night Football it may be used up to twice between Weeks 13-17. During these Flex Scheduling Windows, the games initially scheduled for Sunday Night Football (on NBC), Monday Night Football (on ESPN or ABC), and Thursday Night Football (on Amazon Prime Video) are tentatively scheduled and subject to change. Only Sunday afternoon games (or those listed as TBD) are eligible to be moved to Sunday night, Monday night, or Thursday night, in which case the initially scheduled Sunday/Monday night game would be moved to Sunday afternoon. Sunday afternoon games may also be moved between 1:00 p.m. and 4:05 p.m. or 4:25 p.m. ET. As in prior seasons, for Week 18, the final weekend of the season, the scheduling of the Saturday, Sunday afternoon, and the Sunday night games is not assigned. In Week 18, two games will be played on Saturday (4:30 PM ET and 8:15 PM ET) with the remainder to be played on Sunday afternoon (1:00 PM ET and 4:25 PM ET) and one matchup to be played on Sunday night (8:20 PM ET). Specific dates, start times, and networks for Week 18 matchups will be determined and announced following the conclusion of Week 17. For more information about NFL Flexible Scheduling, please visit",

                        "There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997. Mrs. Patricia Rooney, whose family emigrated from County Mayo in the 1920s, was a guiding force in the establishment of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature.",
                        "When the NFL created the opportunity for all teams to become active in international markets, Ireland was on the team's short list. This license will enable the Steelers to bring back some of the traditions and initiatives instituted by Dan Rooney, as well as to bring some new ones forward."

Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football. Flag is a part of the team's overall international strategy and is easy to play for young people of all ages. The Steelers also plan to enact other events, including watch parties and other football education experiences.",
                        "The team is roughly two years into its NFL's 'Global Markets Program' in Mexico, and in that time, has held several in-market draft celebrations, a kicking clinic for both professional football players as well as young people, a pair of youth flag events, a large-scale watch party in Mexico City, as well as a business summit with members of the business community. We'll look to bring similar initiatives to Ireland; and plan to be thoughtful and intentional about how they are introduced."

Current President Art Rooney II is known as one of the most active NFL owners and one of Pittsburgh's most involved executives in civic affairs, as was his father, the late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney. Steelers players, coaches and front office staff are involved in appearances, charitable donations and outreach programs with nonprofit and community groups. It's our way of giving back to the community that has given us so much!"

                    "This season, \"flexible scheduling\" for Sunday Night Football may be used up to twice between Weeks 5-10, and in the NFL's discretion during Weeks 11-17; for Monday Night Football in the NFL's discretion in Weeks 12-17; and for Thursday Night Football it may be used up to twice between Weeks 13-17. During these Flex Scheduling Windows, the games initially scheduled for Sunday Night Football (on NBC), Monday Night Football (on ESPN or ABC), and Thursday Night Football (on Amazon Prime Video) are tentatively scheduled and subject to change. Only Sunday afternoon games (or those listed as TBD) are eligible to be moved to Sunday night, Monday night, or Thursday night, in which case the initially scheduled Sunday/Monday night game would be moved to Sunday afternoon. Sunday afternoon games may also be moved between 1:00 p.m. and 4:05 p.m. or 4:25 p.m. ET. As in prior seasons, for Week 18, the final weekend of the season, the scheduling of the Saturday, Sunday afternoon, and the Sunday night games is not assigned. In Week 18, two games will be played on Saturday (4:30 PM ET and 8:15 PM ET) with the remainder to be played on Sunday afternoon (1:00 PM ET and 4:25 PM ET) and one matchup to be played on Sunday night (8:20 PM ET). Specific dates, start times, and networks for Week 18 matchups will be determined and announced following the conclusion of Week 17. For more information about NFL Flexible Scheduling, please visit",

Along with being a huge Pittsburgh sports fan, I was also very much into comic books and skateboarding. From an artistic perspective, I've always been the kind of guy who'd rather read a copy of Vaughn Bod\u00e9's Cheech Wizard than stand in a museum, staring at paintings that, more times than not, mean nothing to me. Over the years, not much has changed in that regard. I still love comics, skateboarding, graffiti, rock music and smash mouth Steelers football.",

Over the years, not much has changed in that regard. I still love comics, skateboarding, graffiti, rock music and smash mouth Steelers football.",

                                "Rick Bach is an American painter, sculptor and graphic designer. Originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and a graduate from the Pittsburgh Art Institute, his style was influenced by his early days working alongside his father in an auto body shop. His work ranges from architectural to figurative and is usually painted on metal canvases or sculpted from steel. His motivation is to entertain and provoke while pushing the boundaries between conventional and absurd, functional and useless. Bach currently resides in Washington, D.C., and maintains a studio there as well as in Pittsburgh. For more than 20 years, he has been commissioned by the Big Burrito Restaurant Group to create site-specific murals and sculptures for their restaurants throughout the east coast. Bach's work is in private collections around the world, and he has been featured in numerous solo and group exhibitions. The artist is represented by Zynka Gallery in Pittsburgh and Studio A Global in Washington, D.C.\u00a0\u00a0(Poster curated by",

You study and research and express yourself through a focused lens, to capture the right emotions and theme.

Since then, I've been a designer by trade and have worked with some of the most established outdoor companies in the world. There are over 3 million bikes out in the world with my design work on them. For the last ten years I've been running a small, independent design agency based in Pittsburgh. From The North Face to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, I have worked with a variety of brands on projects that are creatively fulfilling.

Rooney, Sr. founded the team. Current President Art Rooney II is known as one of the most active NFL owners and one of Pittsburgh's most involved executives in civic affairs, as was his father, the late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney. Steelers players, coaches and front office staff are involved in appearances, charitable donations and outreach programs with nonprofit and community groups. It's our way of giving back to the community that has given us so much!"

Rooney, Sr. founded the team. Current President Art Rooney II is known as one of the most active NFL owners and one of Pittsburgh's most involved executives in civic affairs, as was his father, the late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney. Steelers players, coaches and front office staff are involved in appearances, charitable donations and outreach programs with nonprofit and community groups. It's our way of giving back to the community that has given us so much!"

Steelers players, coaches and front office staff are involved in appearances, charitable donations and outreach programs with nonprofit and community groups. It's our way of giving back to the community that has given us so much!"
