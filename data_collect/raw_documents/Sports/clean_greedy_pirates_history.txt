Take a walk along the streets right outside PNC Park and discover four legends forever immortalized with a statue.
FEDERAL STREET
Along Federal Street, you'll find:
Roberto Clemente statue in Center Field	The Roberto Clemente statue was dedicated on July 8, 1994, to kick off All-Star Week in Pittsburgh. It was originally erected outside Gate A at Three Rivers Stadium and is now located outside the Center Field Gate to PNC Park, a few steps away from the Roberto Clemente Bridge.
Willie Stargell statue in Left Field	Unveiled on April 7, 2001, the 12-foot bronze statue stands along Federal Street at the entrance to left field at PNC Park.
MAZEROSKI WAY
On Mazeroski Way, you'll find:
Bill Mazeroski statue at the end of the cul-de-sac in Right Field	As part of the 50th anniversary season of the 1960 World Series Championship, the 12-foot bronze statue was officially unveiled on September 5, 2010, and stands at the end of Mazeroski Way, which is located at the right field entrance to PNC Park.
At the corner of Mazeroski Way and General Robinson Street, you’ll find:
Honus Wagner statue at the Home Plate entrance	The Honus Wagner statue has had three different “homes” since being dedicated on April 30, 1955. Originally, the Wagner statue was located in Schenley Park, close to the Pirates early home, Forbes Field. It was then moved to Three Rivers Stadium and erected outside Gate C on July 21, 1972. The statue is now located at the home plate entrance to PNC Park.

THE EARLY YEARS
arrow-left-12792	Pirates Timeline
The Pirates' roots in Pittsburgh actually date back to April 15, 1876, when the Pittsburgh Alleghenys brought professional baseball to the city by playing their first game at Union Park. In 1877, the Alleghenys were accepted into the minor-league International Association, but disbanded the following year.	Baseball returned to Pittsburgh for good in 1882 when the Alleghenys reformed and joined the American Association, a rival of the National League. After the 1886 season, the Kansas City franchise was expelled from the N.L. and Pittsburgh President William A. Nimmick's application for membership was accepted.	On April 30, 1887, the Alleghenys defeated the defending league-champion Chicago White Stockings, 6-2, before a crowd of nearly 10,000 at Recreation Park. The victorious beginning was not an indication of things to come, however, as the team managed to finish higher than fifth only once in the 13 remaining seasons of the century. In 1890, the Alleghenys' roster was demolished when key players jumped to a new rival to the National League - the Players League. They staggered to a club-record 113 losses as the two leagues engaged in a bitter battle over talent.	When the Players League folded after only one season, all players were expected to return to the clubs they played for in 1889. But in 1891 Pittsburgh signed Louis Bierbauer, a second baseman with Brooklyn of the Players League who had spent the previous four seasons with the Philadelphia Athletics. The A's and their American Association brethren immediately accused Pittsburgh of "pirating" Bierbauer away from them. Pittsburgh kept the player and the nickname and became known as the Pirates thereafter.	The fortunes of the Pirates turned in 1900 when the National League reduced its membership from 12 to eight teams. As part of the move, Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the defunct Louisville club, acquired controlling interest of the Pirates. In the largest player transaction in Pirates history, the Hall-of-Fame owner brought 14 players with him from the Louisville roster, including Hall of Famers Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke and Rube Waddell - plus standouts Deacon Phillippe, Chief Zimmer, Claude Ritchey and Tommy Leach. All would play significant roles as the Pirates became the league's dominant franchise, winning pennants in 1901, 1902 and 1903 and a World championship in 1909.	Wagner, dubbed "The Flying Dutchman," was the game's premier player during the decade, winning seven batting titles and leading the majors in hits (1,850) and RBI (956) from 1900-1909. One of the pioneers of the game, Dreyfuss is sometimes called "The Father of the World Series" because he challenged Henry Killilea, the owner of the American League champion Boston Americans, to a post-season playoff in 1903 to determine who was baseball's best team. On October 1, 1903, Phillippe defeated the legendary Cy Young, 7-3, in the first World Series game ever played. Boston, however, later emerged as the Series winner, overcoming a three-games-to- one deficit to win the best-of-nine competition, five games to three. In the Series, Phillippe started five of the games.	The Pirates finished as runner-up three times in the next five years before getting another shot at a World Series title in 1909. The Bucs won a club-record 110 games that year with three pitchers - Howie Camnitz (25), Vic Willis (22) and Lefty Leifield (19) combining for 66 victories. The Series pitted the league's batting champions - Wagner and Detroit's Ty Cobb against each other, but rookie pitcher Babe Adams, who was 12-3 during the regular season, emerged as the Series hero for the Pirates.	While Camnitz, Willis and Leifield failed to win a game, Adams won three, including a six-hit shutout in the seventh and deciding game. It was the last of four titles the Pirates would win under Clarke, who managed the club until 1915.	Continue to The Forbes Field Years >>

THE THREE RIVERS STADIUM YEARS
arrow-left-12795	Pirates Timeline
The changing of the decade also brought along a change to the home ballpark of the Pirates. After playing in cavernous Forbes Field since June 30, 1909, the Bucs began play at a multi-purpose stadium located at the confluence of Pittsburgh's three rivers. The aptly named Three Rivers Stadium played host to its first game on July 16, 1970, with the Pirates losing a 3-2 decision to the Reds.
During the 1970's, the Pirates were again among baseball's premier teams. In that 10-year span, they won six division titles and finished as low as third only once. In the first 25 years of divisional play, the Bucs won more games (2,100) and finished first more often (nine times) than any other N.L. East club. The Pirates put together a 2,100-1,878 record during that period (.528 winning %).
The Pirates captured two more World Championships during the 1970's. Their 1971 victory over Baltimore was a showcase for Clemente, who batted .414 and received the Series MVP award.
In 1979, the Pirates became only the fourth team in history to erase a three-games-to-one deficit when they again bested the Orioles in seven games. Hall of Famer Willie Stargell took home MVP honors - as he did during the regular season - with a .400 batting average, three home runs (including the Series' deciding blow in Game Seven) and seven RBI. It was a fitting conclusion to the decade for Stargell, who was the leading home run hitter of the 1970's (296). While the Pirates brought two world championships back to Pittsburgh during the 1970s, the Pittsburgh Steelers also came to prominence. The Steelers won four Super Bowls during the 70s, which, coupled with the Pirates success, helped garner Pittsburgh the "City of Champions" label.
On October 2, 1985, the Galbreath family and Warner Communications sold the club to Pittsburgh Associates; a group of private investors who were committed to keeping the team in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Associates was made up of 10 investors representing	six corporations, three individuals and Carnegie Mellon Univer- sity. The group included the Aluminum Company of America, Mellon Bank, PNC Financial Corporation, PPG Industries, USX Corporation, Westinghouse Electric Company, Eugene and Raymond Litman, John McConnell and Harvey M. Walken.
After several lean years in the mid-eighties, the Pirates returned to contention in 1988 when they finished in second place and broke the club's 28-year-old attendance mark.
With players like Barry Bonds, Doug Drabek, Bobby Bonilla and Andy Van Slyke, Pittsburgh started the decade of the 1990's in fine fashion, winning the N.L. East title three straight years. The Bucs became the first team to win three straight division titles since the Philadelphia Phillies accomplished the feat between 1976 and 1978. Bonds captured MVP honors in 1990 and 1992, while Drabek won the Cy Young award in '90. Manager Jim Leyland took home N.L. Manager-of-the-Year honors in both 1990 and 1992. In his 11 seasons at the helm, Leyland won 849 games, placing him third on the club's All-Time Managerial win list.
Pittsburgh was on the brink of a World Series berth in both the 1991 and 1992 season, but the Pirates lost the seventh and deciding game each year to the Atlanta Braves. In 1992, Pittsburgh came within three outs of the Fall Classic. But in the bottom of the ninth inning at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, the Braves triumphed with three runs and won the game 3-2 and the series, four-games-to-three.
The people of Pittsburgh and the surrounding Tri-State area responded well to the club's success in the nineties as the Pirates drew in excess of two million fans in both 1990 and 1991.
A crowd of 59,568, the largest ever to watch a professional baseball game in Pittsburgh, witnessed the 65th Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12, 1994. In one of the most thrilling All-Star Games ever to be played, the National League prevailed over the American League in extra frames. Fred McGriff helped send the game into extra innings when he delivered a two-run, pinch- hit home run off Lee Smith in the bottom of the ninth inning that tied the score. After the American League failed to score in the top of the 10th inning, the National League broke its six-game losing streak when Tony Gwynn scored on a double by Moises Alou.
A new chapter of Pirate history began on February 14, 1996, when Kevin McClatchy and his group of investors purchased the storied franchise from Pittsburgh Associates.
Picked by many publications to finish last in 1997, the Pirates remained in the division race until the final weekend of the season and the club was named USA Today's "Organization of the Year" at the conclusion of the season. Major League Baseball also	underwent a change in 1997 with the birth of Interleague play. That season, the Pirates welcomed the Kansas City Royals to Three Rivers Stadium on June 13 for the club's first interleague matchup, which Pittsburgh won by a score of 5-3.
While the Bucs contended for the division during the entire 1997 season, one of the most memorable moments of the season came on July 12. That night, pitchers Francisco Cordova and Ricardo Rincon thrilled Pirates fans with the only combined, extra-inning no-hitter in major league history. The game ended in the bottom of the 10th inning when Mark Smith delivered a three-run home run for the 3-0 win.
The 2000 season brought an end to a full century of great moments, a 100-year period which began with three straight National League pennants and ended with an aura of hope and dreams of more championships to come. With a new home on the horizon, the Bucs said goodbye to Three Rivers Stadium with their final game ever played there on October 1, 2000. Three no-hitters, Clemente's 3000th hit, two All-Star Games, countless playoff games, two World Championships and endless summer evenings can be associated with no other place in the history of Pittsburgh than Three Rivers Stadium.
The Pirates closed out their 30-year tenure at Three Rivers Stadium with a 10-9 loss to the Chicago Cubs in the final game of what was the club's home since 1970. Pittsburgh native John Wehner smacked the final home run in the history of the ballpark off Chicago's Jon Lieber. Ironically, Wehner also grounded out to third base for the final out ever at Three Rivers. With the loss, Pittsburgh closed out Three Rivers Stadium with a record of 1,324 wins and 1,082 losses.
In the early morning of February 11, 2001, Pittsburgh bid farewell to Three Rivers when the home of the Pirates and Steelers was imploded.

THE PNC PARK YEARS
arrow-left-14715	Pirates Timeline
PNC Park officially opened its gates on April 9, 2001. Regarded by many as the best ballpark ever built, PNC Park is an intimate two-level structure which offers all fans dramatic views of the downtown skyline as well as the natural grass playing surface. After touring all 30 major league ballparks during the summer of 2003, ESPN.com ranked PNC Park as the best in baseball.
The anticipation and joy of a new ballpark turned to sorrow, when on the morning of the first regular season game at PNC Park, a beloved member of the Pirates family was lost when Willie Stargell passed away on April 9, 2001.
Despite suffering 100 losses for just the seventh time in club history in 2001, fans came out in record numbers as the Bucs played in front of 19 sellouts and a total of 2,436,139 customers during the inaugural season at PNC Park.
On June 25, 2002, the Pirates registered the 9,000th win in the history of the franchise with a 4-1 victory over the Montreal Expos, thus becoming just the fourth club to produce 9,000 wins.
The Pirates have had a long list of sluggers in their history and Brian Giles added his name to that list during his five seasons in a Bucco uniform. He hit 30 or more home runs in each of his first four seasons with the club, just one of three Pirates to hit 30 or more long balls in four consecutive years (also Hall-of-Famers Ralph Kiner and Willie Stargell). His 165 home runs with Pittsburgh rank seventh in club history.
Catcher Jason Kendall spent each of his first nine big league seasons in a Pittsburgh uniform after being selected in the first round of the 1992 June draft. In that time, he made 1,205 appearances behind the plate. That figure ranks first all-time in the annals of the club, 50 games ahead of George Gibson, who caught for the Bucs from 1906 thru 1915. Kendall surpassed Gibson's 90-year-old record in Los Angeles on August 3, 2004.
For the first time in team history a Pittsburgh player captured Rookie-of-the-Year honors as outfielder Jason Bay took home the honors in 2004. A two-time National League All-Star, Bay was a fan favorite at the 2006 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh.
The national spotlight shined once again on the city of Pittsburgh during the 2006 season as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at PNC Park, marking the fifth time the event has been held in the Steel City. The American League won a dramatic 3-2 decision in the Midsummer Classic as the Pirates became the first team in baseball history to host the All-Star Game in three different venues.
Also in 2006, Freddy Sanchez added his name to the club's record list of 25 batting champions as his .344 average led the National League. Sanchez banged out 200 hits in 2006 and led the N.L. with 53 doubles while being named to his first of two All-Star teams.
On January 18, 2007, Bob Nutting officially assumed control of the ballclub, thus becoming only the sixth principal owner in the Pirates storied history. Following a deep look into the team's operations, Nutting has built a fundamentally different	organization by introducing Frank Coonelly as the team's new president on September 13, 2007 and, in-turn, Neal Huntington as the team's new general manager on September 25, 2007. From there the new leadership team has made significant changes to each of the three major areas - Major League manager/coaching staff, Scouting Director and Farm Director, with the goal of building an organization that can consistently compete.
Since 2009, fans have witnessed the debuts of many first-round draft picks, including Andrew McCutchen, Pedro Alvarez, Neil Walker, Gerrit Cole and Jameson Taillon along with appearances of many other young players, including Starling Marte, Gregory Polanco and Josh Bell.
Clint Hurdle was named manager of the Pirates on November 15, 2010, and in his first seven seasons at the helm, the inspirational leader of the club has posted a 584-549-1 record while leading the Bucs to the postseason three times.
During the 2012 campaign, Bucco fans showed their great support of the club as the Pirates played host to 17 sellouts during the season.
McCutchen also emerged as one of the best players in the game, winning a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger award in 2012 while finishing third in the National League MVP voting.
In 2013 the Pirates returned to prominence in the league as they won 94 regular season games and appeared in the postseason for the first time since 1992.
The Pirates placed five players on the 2013 All-Star team - the most since also having five selected to the 1972 Midsummer Classic. Along with McCutchen, Pedro Alvarez, Jason Grilli, Jeff Locke and Mark Melancon represented the Bucs at the 2013 All-Star Game, played at Citi Field in New York.
Led by 16-game winner and the National League Comeback Player-of-the-Year Francisco Liriano, the Bucco pitching staff posted 16 shutouts in 2013 and ranked third in the N.L. with a 3.26 ERA; the best mark by the pitching staff since 1984. Grilli (33) and Melancon (16) picked up 49 of the club-record and National League leading 55 saves.
The offense was led by McCutchen, who took home N.L. MVP honors in 2013 after hitting .317 with 97 runs, 38 doubles, 21 home runs, 84 RBI and 27 stolen bases in 157 games. McCutchen became the sixth player in club history to win the MVP award, joining Dick Groat (1960), Roberto Clemente (1966), Dave Parker (1978), Willie Stargell (1979) and Barry Bonds (1990, 1992).
Silver Slugger award winner Pedro Alvarez shared the league lead in home runs in 2013, as the young slugger smacked 36 long balls to become the first Bucco to lead or share the N.L. lead in homers since Willie Stargell did so with 44 in 1973.
After winning 94 games during the 2013 regular season and finishing second in the N.L. Central division standings, the Pirates defeated the Reds in the Wild Card playoff game, played before a sold out crowd at PNC Park on October 1. The game would officially launch the kickoff to Buctober for years to come.
2013 Wild Card Game
The Pirates had a two-games-to-one lead in the best of five Division Series playoff against the Cardinals, but dropped the final two games to bring an end to their magical 2013 campaign.	The Pirates produced a record 23 sellouts during the 2013 regular season before playing in front of three standing-room only crowds in the postseason.	Clint Hurdle also took home some hardware following the 2013 season as he was named the N.L. Manager-of-the Year; just the second Bucco skipper to win the award.	The Pirates reached the postseason again in 2014 while drawing 2,442,564 fans and averaging 30,155 for their 81 home dates. In addition, the Bucs posted 23 regular season sellouts for the second consecutive year.	With a combination of the second-best OBP in the National League (.333) and a pitching staff that posted the second- lowest ERA (2.94) over the final two months of the season, the Pirates won 88 games in 2014, finishing 2.0 games behind St. Louis in the Central division race.	Josh Harrison finished second in the N.L. batting race while Andrew McCutchen once again put up MVP-type numbers, leading the Pirates to the postseason in back-to-back seasons for just the sixth time in franchise history.	The final game of the 2014 season was played on October 1 as a standing-room only crowd of 40,629 watched eventual World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner shut down the Bucs in the Wild Card Game as the Giants began their run toward the championship.	For the sixth time in franchise history, and for the first time since 1991, the Pirates won 98 games in a season as the 2015 squad posted a 98-64 record. The Pirates also established a club-record attendance figure in 2015, drawing 2,498,596 fans and averaging 30,847 fans for their 81 home dates. The Bucs went 53-28 at home, setting a record for most wins in a season at PNC Park.	During the 2015 campaign, Pittsburgh posted its 10,000th franchise win on September 24, becoming the fifth club to record as many victories.	For the third straight year the Pirates hosted the N.L. Wild Card Game in 2015, making the postseason three consecutive years for just the fourth time in team history.	Mark Melancon set a club record and led the Major Leagues with 51 saves in 2015. In addition, Gerrit Cole won 19 games, Starling Marte captured a Gold Glove Award for his fielding excellence and Korean import Jung Ho Kang was a finalist for N.L. Rookie- of-the-Year.	The 2017 season saw the emergence of another young talented player as Josh Bell set a National League record for most home runs hit by a switch-hitting rookie (26).	Bell placed his name in the record books during the 2019 season, putting up one of the best offensive months in MLB history. The N.L. All-Star hit .390 with 12 homers, 31 RBI and a 1.238 OPS in May while setting the club record for most total bases (94) in a month. He also became just the third National League player in history to produce at least 12 doubles and 12 home runs in any calendar month.	Derek Shelton was named the 41st manager in team history on November 27, 2019 while Ben Cherington took over General Manager duties - the 13th GM in Pirates history - prior to the 2020 campaign.	The 2020 season was shortened to 60 games due to the international COVID-19 pandemic. Travel was also limited as the Pirates played teams only from the N.L. and A.L. Central divisions.	For the 50th time in club history, a Gold Glove award was given to a Pirates player as Jacob Stallings took home the hardware for his catching excellence in 2021.	A total of 25 rookies appeared in at least one game for the Bucs in 2022 and combined for a club-record 56 home runs, led by Jack Suwinski (19) and Oneil Cruz (17).	In 2023, Mitch Keller set the club record for most strikeouts by a right-handed pitcher (210) while third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes captured a Gold Glove award - the first won by a Pittsburgh player at that position.

UNIFORMS AND LOGOS
arrow-left-14764	Pirates History
UNIFORMS: 1900 - PRESENT
1900-1910:	The jersey of this period was short-sleeved with no trim except for a dark blue collar. Stockings were dark blue with red stripes and the cap was blue with a white "P". A "PBC" monogram signifying Pittsburgh Baseball Club was also added to the left sleeve later in the decade.	1910-1920:	The regular collar was replaced by the short, stand-up "cadet" style with a button collar. Pinstriped material was also introduced. As the team nickname became more accepted, "Pirates" was displayed in capital letters down the button lapel (1912). The cadet-style collar soon gave way to a tapered collar extension, but the buttonlapel remained solid dark blue with white buttons and a "P-P" straddling the top button (1913-14). Later in this decade, the cap had piping and also included a "P" in white or red.	1921-1932:	Standard white uniforms were worn at home and gray on the road with simple graphics and solid colors. The 1925 and '27 championship teams wore the standard capital ?P? on its sleeves but not on the jersey. A red ?P? was also placed on the solid blue cap.	1933-1937:	The Pirate uniforms brightened up considerably with added colors, trim features and graphics. The name "Pirates" was placed across the jersey in an arc of fancy red and blue capital letters. Solid blue belts were included and piping trim on the uniforms included blue and red. A red "P" was also placed on the solid blue cap.	1938:	The name "Pirates" appeared on the jersey in script lettering with underline flourish.	1939-1946:	A zipper front replaced the button-down jersey.	1940:	The uniform abandons the traditional "P" or "Pirates" for an emblem of an actual buccaneer. The patch was placed on the left breast of both the home and road jerseys. This was the first time an emblem of the team's nickname was ever worn on a game jersey.	1948:	The team replaced the traditional blue and red with the present day black and gold. The script "Pirates" and "Pittsburgh" was replaced with the block lettering that you still see today. The cap became solid black with a gold "P".	1953:	The word "Pittsburgh" is removed from the road jersey, and replaced with "Pirates".	1957:	The Pirates became the second team to begin wearing sleeveless jerseys.
1962:	Numbers were introduced on the front of the home and road jerseys and have been there ever since.	1970:	The Pirates became the first major league club to adopt the new double-knit fabric uniforms, which they debuted at the first game at the new Three Rivers Stadium. The jersey became a pullover with no button or zipper. The pants contained a built-in sash belt. The cap crown was mustard yellow with a black bill. Within two years, nearly every other club was wearing a double-knit uniform.	1976:	The Pirates, as well as other clubs, commemorate the National League's centennial by wearing the old striped, pill-box style caps. The Bucs wore yellow caps with a black bill and black stripes.	1977-1979:	Abandoned were the traditional white and gray uniforms in exchange for combinations of white, gold, black iand pinstriping. The caps became black with yellow stripes. Players' last names appear on the back of the jerseys for the first time.	1985:	The Pirates returned to the basic white and gray uniform.	1987:	The Pirates replaced the striped cap in favor of the traditional standard black round crown type.	1990:	A script "Pittsburgh" is added to the gray road uniform for the first time since 1952.	1991:	The Pirates return to button-down jerseys and belted pants.	1995:	Going back to a more traditional look, the Pirates removed the names from the back of the jerseys.	1996:	That change lasted only one year, as the Pirates return the names to the back of the jerseys.	1997:	The organization introduce a complete new look by introducing an alternate home jersey as well as bringing the color "red" back into the uniform for the first time since 1946.	2001:	With the opening of PNC Park, the club enters a "New Era of Baseball." The team re-introduces the sleeveless jersey as part of both the home and road uniform. The Pirates also become the first team ever to wear a cap with a red underbill (cap worn with the alternate home jersey only).	2005:	The Pirates re-introduce pinstripes to the uniform. The alternate uniforms are worn on Sunday home games.	2007:	The club introduces a red, sleeveless jersey to be worn on selected home dates.	2009:	The Pirates re-introduce sleeves to their home and road jerseys and added a black alternate jersey. The sleeveless pinstriped jersey are worn on Sundays through the end of 2010.	2013:	The club introduces an alternate uniform mustard gold cap which was worn on Sunday home games throughout the season. The pullover style jersey was similar to the one from the early 1970's. The front of the jersey featured black "Pirates" lettering outlined in mustard gold on the chest, as well as the player's number below the lettering on the left hand side of the jersey. The players' names were added to the back of the jerseys to go along with their number, as opposed to the 1970 jerseys that did not feature the names. These jerseys were worn through the end of 2015.	2015:	The club introduces camouflage jerseys to be worn on selected home dates.	2016:	The Pirates unveil a new Sunday alternate uniform, a replica of the iconic 1979 World Champion Pirates uniform. The gold v-neck pullover jersey is accompanied by black pants, designed with two gold stripes running down the outside of each leg.

THE FORBES FIELD YEARS
arrow-left-15486	Pirates Timeline
The 1909 season also marked the beginning of a new era in ballparks as the Pirates christened Forbes Field on June 30 that year. Since 1891, the Pirates had called Exposition Park - which was located on virtually the same site as Three Rivers Stadium - their home. Described as the "Hialeah of Ballparks" when it opened, Forbes Field would remain the home of the Pirates for six decades and would host many great moments.	Pittsburgh sank to the league's second division for most of the next decade, but by the early 1920's - with an influx of outstanding talent which included future Hall of Famers Pie Traynor, Kiki Cuyler, Rabbit Maranville and Max Carey - Pittsburgh was again a contender. After three straight third- place finishes from 1922 to 1924, the Pirates won the N.L. title by eight and a half games over the second-place New York Giants in 1925.	The Series matched Pittsburgh against the Washington Senators, who jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead. The Pirates, however, bounced back to win the final three games and the Series. Their miraculous comeback included a 15-hit pounding of Hall of Famer Walter "Big Train" Johnson in Game Seven.	In 1926, a rookie named Paul Waner joined the Bucs and batted .336. A year later, his brother Lloyd joined him and belted out 223 hits for a club rookie record .355 average and the Pirates were again National League champions. Paul, who was nicknamed "Big Poison" - batted .300 or better 14 times, captured three batting titles and collected 200 or more hits in eight different seasons. He was named the league's Most Valuable Player in 1927 and went on to compile 3,152 hits and a .333 career batting average. Lloyd - who was tagged "Little Poison" - hit .300 or better in 10 of his first 12 seasons, compiled a career mark of .316 and accumulated 2,450 hits. Both were elected to the Hall of Fame.	The 1927 World Series featured the Pirates against New York's famed "Murderer's Row" with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, who swept Pittsburgh in four straight games. The next 33 years, Pirate fans went without a pennant winner, although they were not denied their share of great players and great moments.	The Waners were consistently among baseball's premier hitters during the 1930's with Paul amassing more hits (1,959) during the decade than any player in baseball. Traynor was one of the era's best all-around players and is generally regarded as one of the finest third basemen ever to play the game. Shortstop Arky Vaughan topped the .300-mark in each of his 10 seasons with the Pirates (1932-1941) and his .385 average in 1935 has gone unequalled by any National League performer. He, too, is enshrined at Cooperstown.	Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner won or shared the N.L. home run title in each of the seven seasons that he wore a Pirates uniform (1946-52) - which is a streak that has never been matched in either league. In 1956, Pirate first baseman Dale Long hit home runs in a record eight straight games between May 19th and May 28th (that mark was matched by Don Mattingly in 1987 and Ken Griffey Jr. in 1993). Three years later, Harvey Haddix hurled what many consider the greatest game ever pitched when he retired 36 straight Milwaukee Braves hitters over 12 innings on May 26, 1959. The same year, ElRoy Face won 17 straight games in relief.	Though the Pirates failed to finish higher than seventh from 1950 through 1957, the foundation for another championship was being put into place. Standout players were added throughout the decade, including 2001 Hall-of-Fame inductee Bill Mazeroski, Dick Groat, Vernon Law, Bob Friend, Bill Virdon, Face and Hall-of-Fame right fielder Roberto Clemente.	In 1956, Pirate owner John Galbreath hired Joe L. Brown as general manager. With the club languishing in last place at 36-67 midway through the 1957 campaign, Brown promoted coach Danny Murtaugh to field manager. Within three seasons, the Bucs were again champions of the National League and again matched against the powerful New York Yankees in the World Series. This time the Bronx Bombers featured Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.	The 1960 World Series remains one of the most incredible post-season encounters ever on record. The Yankees won Game Two, Game Three and Game Six by a combined score of 38-3, but the Pirates used great pitching, defense and timely hitting to stretch the Series to a seventh game at Forbes Field. Pittsburgh took a 9-7 lead into the ninth - thanks to Hal Smith's three-run homer in the eighth - but the Yankees came up with two runs in the top of the ninth to tie the score. The game and the Series ended, however, in the bottom of the ninth as Mazeroski belted what is perhaps the most dramatic home run in baseball history off Ralph Terry. Mazeroski was the only player in baseball history ever to end a World Series with a home run until Joe Carter of Toronto accomplished the feat in Game Six of the 1993 Fall Classic.	During the 1960's, Clemente established himself among the game's elite players. He collected more hits (1,877) than anyone during the decade and would go on to reach the 3,000-hit plateau in 1972. During his marvelous career, he topped the .300 mark 13 times, won four batting titles and was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1966.	Continue to The Three Rivers Stadium Years >>

For the 2024 season, the Pirates have renovated the PBC Club Level, where fans will be greeted with the opportunity to explore the evolution of baseball in Pittsburgh as the Club continues to build on storytelling of Pittsburgh’s rich history of baseball with newly displayed artwork.	Wigle is the new presenting partner for the PBC Club Level. Wigle’s unique skew of liquors are featured through three distinct bars:	The “City of Champions” Bar on third base side.	The “Wigle Whiskey” Bar behind home plate.	The “Wigle Reserve” Bar on first base side.	Each bar acts as a staple in their respective area within the club. New carpet, paint schemes, and furniture help define each “zone”, creating several unique experiences.
ALONG THE CLUB LEVEL
In City of Champions (Left Field), you’ll find:
A showcase of colorful, bold artwork celebrating many legends of the game, including Bill Mazeroski, Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell. Sports Illustrated covers featuring icons from the Pirates, Penguins and Steelers hang in this space, along with autographed jerseys from Roberto Clemente and Bill Mazeroski.
In Wigle Whiskey (Behind Home Plate), you’ll find:
Artist Gary Cieradkowski’s set of digital illustrations celebrating the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords, paired with Negro League jerseys, programs and photos from Pittsburgh photographer, Charles “Teenie” Harris. Other compositions of note include tributes to Forbes Field and Hall-of-Fame broadcaster Bob Prince.
In Wigle Reserve (Right Field), you’ll find:
A look back to the Pirates’ early years and play off the old-school, “cigar bar” feel of the room. A selection of 1909 player cards have been reproduced at large scale (featuring Honus Wagner’s iconic T-206 card). You can also read about Louis Bierbauer and how the Pirates got their current nickname and see hand drawn illustrations of Pirate greats.
Other Items on the Club Level include:
Through the corridors connecting these three spaces, impactful selections from local artists Tom Mosser, Dino Guarino, and Cody Sabol are showcased prominently. In addition, each club elevator lobby tells a story: the architectural development of PNC Park, a celebration of the 2006 All Star Game, and the ballclub’s early evolution.	We welcome fans to explore all areas of the PBC Club and enjoy the latest chapter of PNC Park enhancements on game days as well as during the popular PNC Park tours offered daily.
