            "Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world\u2019s\n          leading conductors, whose distinctive and revelatory interpretations\n          receive great international acclaim. As Music Director of the\n          Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the\n          2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home\n          and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural\n          ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include\n          Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major\n          venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg\n          Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival,\n          Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads\n          the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour,\n          starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the\n          prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus.",
            "Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively\n          documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring\n          works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss,\n          Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding\n          reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY\u00ae nominations, and he and the\n          orchestra won the GRAMMY\u00ae for \"Best Orchestral Performance\" in 2018.\n          The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with\n          Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical\n          acclaim.",
            "Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the\n          University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a\n          member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna\n          State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a\n          conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination\n          to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his\n          conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of\n          the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the\n          Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize\n          in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of\n          the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian\n          National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic\n          Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the\n          Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he\n          was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra,\n          following decades of close collaboration.",
            "Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his\n          four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he\n          conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss,\n          Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses\n          such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la\n          Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg\n          Festival. In 2020, Beethoven\u2019s anniversary year, he conducted a new\n          staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In\n          autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, \n          leading a revival of Mozart\u2019sIdomeneo. Beyond the\n          podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites,\n          including Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019sJen\u016ffa, Strauss\u2019sElektra, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019sRusalkaas\n          well as Puccini'sTurandotwhich he regularly performs around the\n          globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss\u2019sSalome, was premiered\n          by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023.",
            "As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading\n          international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra,\n          Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig,\n          Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Z\u00fcrich, Royal Concertgebouw\n          Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di\n          Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic.

Tourangeau\u2019s personal and professional commitment to creating deep and meaningful connections between music, musicians and the community is a hallmark of her leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, one of America\u2019s most distinguished orchestras.",

She is currently leading a new initiative to promote diversity and inclusion across the organization, with patrons, and with the community. Under Tourangeau\u2019s leadership, the Pittsburgh Symphony has extended the contract of its Music Director, Manfred Honeck, welcomed ten new musicians to the Orchestra and brought new distinguished members of the community to the Board. She successfully led negotiations for a new contract with members of the Orchestra. Tourangeau has represented the orchestra on several highly acclaimed domestic and international tours, enhancing the orchestra\u2019s international reputation. During her tenure, the orchestra\u2019s illustrious recording history has been underscored with numerous GRAMMY Awards and nominations, including the award for Best Orchestral Performance in 2018.",

Prior to that, she was the education coordinator at the Akron Symphony Orchestra.",

The band is reproducing what Pink Floyd did on the albums as closely as possible, and then having an orchestra behind the band gives the music a richness, a whole different feel, a whole different sense of depth.\u201d",

            "Raised in D.C. and Reykjavik, with Icelandic and Chinese roots, Laufey\u2019s classical piano and cello training from her mother collided with her love for her father\u2019s jazz records to create a contemporary and eclectic musical style.

To  mitigate these losses, the Orchestra says that it must now take additional  steps beyond the measures announced in May to address the continued devastating  financial impact of the pandemic.",

            "The two-time 2018 GRAMMY\u00aeAward-winning Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is credited with a rich history of engaging the world\u2019s finest conductors and musicians and demonstrates a genuine commitment to the Pittsburgh region and its citizens. Known for its artistic excellence for more than120 years, past music directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg(1952-1976), Andr\u00e9 Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss Jansons (1997-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music directors was continued in fall 2008,when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. The Pittsburgh Symphony is continually at the forefront of championing new American works. They premiered Leonard Bernstein\u2019s Symphony No. 1 \u201cJeremiah\u201din1944, John Adams\u2019 Short Ride in a Fast Machine in1986, and Mason Bates\u2019 Resurrexit in 2018 to celebrate Manfred Honeck\u2019s 60th birthday. The orchestra has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and live radio broadcasts. Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra have received multiple GRAMMY\u00aenominations for Best Orchestral Performance, taking home the award in 2018 for their recording of Shostakovich: Symphony No. 5; Barber: Adagio. As early as1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony has been broadcasted on the radio. Since 1982, the orchestra has received increased attention through national network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by ClassicalWQED-FM89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Lauded as the Pittsburgh region\u2019s international cultural ambassador, in 2019 the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under the leadership of Music Director Manfred Honeck, embarked on an extensive tour of Europe, the 25th in orchestra history.",
            "In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Pittsburgh Symphony to cancel the remainder of its concerts for the 2019-2020 season. Instead, the Symphony offered online concerts throughout the 2020-2021 season. The Pittsburgh Symphony celebrated its 125th anniversary with an online gala in February 2021. In summer of 2021, the Pittsburgh Symphony began to perform to a live audience outdoors, and eventually in the fall, Heinz Hall was reopened to audiences.",
            "In 2020, the Pittsburgh Symphony welcomed its second Principal Pops Conductor, Byron Stripling. A conductor, trumpet virtuoso, singer, and actor, Stripling has been a featured soloist with pops orchestras across the country. He has performed with jazz notables from the Count Basie Orchestra and the bands of Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Brubeck, Lionel Hampton, and more. Stripling\u2019s first concert as Principal Pops conductor was an online performance in October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He continued to have multiple \u201cfirsts\u201d with the symphony, performing his first in-person concert in summer of 2021 at Hartwood Acres, and his first in-person Pops concert of the season at Heinz Hall in fall of the same year.",

            "For Immediate ReleaseJuly 23, 2018View Concert Page \u2192PITTSBURGH, PA\u2014 Following a sold out 25th\u00a0Anniversary World Tour and Greatest Hits release, Grammy nominated multi-platinum pop-rock trio HANSON is beginning their next 25 years with a musical project unmatched in their history, String Theory symphonic tour and album set to launch this summer and continue through Spring 2019.String Theory brings together an exciting collaboration of song craftsmanship and symphonic majesty, framing the established trio\u2019s music through a special collaboration with Academy award winning arranger David Campbell, spawning both a world tour featuring the band playing live with Symphony Orchestras, and a studio album.HANSON\u2019s most ambitious musical project to date features songs spanning the band\u2019s career, including some of their best known material (\u201cMmmBop\u201d, \u201cWhere\u2019s The Love\u201d, \u201cThis Time Around\u201d and more) alongside brand new or never-released-to-the-public songs (\u201cReaching For The Sky\u201d, \u201cBattle Cry\u201d, \u201cBreaktown\u201d, \u201cNo Rest For The Weary\u201d and more) which tell a story of aspiration, despair, fortitude and ultimately a return to optimism.Fans can discover String Theory both as an album and as a concert, with North American dates starting Summer 2018 and running through Summer 2019, and music released in Fall 2018.The Tour brings String Theory to the stage with many leading symphonies at some of the most iconic venues, among them the National Symphony Orchestra at the Filene Center at Wolftrap and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at Heinz Hall, already announced earlier this year and on sale now. New dates include Los Angeles at The Greek Theatre, New York at the Beacon Theatre and Chicago at the Chicago Theatre, on sale July 27th. US and Canada dates continue throughout the Spring of 2019, with international dates to be announced later this month taking the tour to Europe, Australia, and more in Spring 2019.The album features brand new and rearranged recordings with full symphonic orchestration, and will be available in digital and physical formats, with special content and packages available via the band\u2019s official website www.Hanson.net. The band recordings were produced by HANSON and mixed by Grammy winning Producer and Engineer Jim Scott (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tom Petty, Wilco, Sting). The symphonic composition was recorded in Prague, lead by arranger David Campbell. New HANSON recordings were engineered by Craig Alvin (Kacey Musgraves) with additional production and engineering credits including past collaborators of the band, Danny Kortchmar (Don Henley, Billy Joel, James Taylor), Joe Chicarelli (The Strokes, Frank Zappa, The White Stripes), Steve Churchyard (The Eagles, Train, Faith Hill, Taylor Swift), Greg Wells (Mika, Rufus Wainwright, Adele) and CJ Eiriksson (U2, Matchbox Twenty, Phish).String Theory is the next frontier for HANSON, telling a story of aspiration and fortitude against the odds. The music resonates with authenticity, coming from a group whose signature is never to chase trends, but instead to stay focused on their melodic craftsmanship, establishing themselves as one of the few artists of their generation able to continually reinvent and reimagine their music, which has helped them to maintain an active global fanbase over 25 years after their founding.",

            "The 2018 GRAMMY Award-winning PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, known for its artistic excellence for more than 120 years, is credited with a rich history of the world's finest conductors and musicians, and a strong commitment to the Pittsburgh region and its citizens. Past music directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg (1952-1976), Andre Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss Jansons (1995-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music directors was furthered in fall 2008, when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The orchestra has been at the forefront of championing new American works, and gave the first performance of Leonard Bernstein's Symphony No. 1 \"Jeremiah\" in 1944 and John Adams' Short Ride in a Fast Machine in 1986. The Pittsburgh Symphony has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and radio concerts. Its \"Pittsburgh Live!\" series with Reference Recordings has resulted in back-to-back Grammy Nominations in 2015 and 2016. As early as 1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony broadcast on the airwaves coast-to-coast and in the late 1970s it made the ground breaking PBS series \"Previn and the Pittsburgh.\" The orchestra has received increased national attention since 1982 through network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by Classical WQED-FM 89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. With a long and distinguished history of touring both domestically and overseas since 1900 \u2014 including international tours to Europe, the Far East and South America\u2014the Pittsburgh Symphony continues to be critically acclaimed as one of the world's greatest orchestras.",
            "Renowned for his distinctive interpretations, Manfred Honeck has served as Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra since the 2008/09 season. The 2017/18 season marked 10 years of this acclaimed partnership, highlighted by special commissions to commemorate this decade of successful music-making. Consistently recognized for their performances, he and the orchestra are celebrated both in Pittsburgh and abroad, and regularly perform in major music capitals and festivals.",
            "Manfred Honeck's successful work with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is extensively documented on recordings by the Reference Recordings label. All albums released by Reference Recordings \u2014 amongst them Strauss tone poems and suites, Bruckner's Symphony No. 4, Beethoven Symphonies No. 5 and 7, and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 \u2014 have received numerous rave reviews and honors. Honeck and the orchestra received two Grammy nominations for Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Symphony No. 8 and the Symphonic Suite from Jan\u00e1\u010dek's opera Jen\u016ffa, conceptualized by the artist himself, as well as for Bruckner's Symphony No. 4. In January 2018, they were honored with the Grammy Award for \"Best Orchestral Performance\" for their recording of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 and Barber's Adagio for Strings.",
            "As a guest conductor, Honeck has worked with the world's leading orchestras including the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome, and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted the New York Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He is also a regular guest at the Verbier Festival. His operatic guest appearances include Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, the White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg and the Salzburg Festival. He also has served as Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for more than twenty years.",
            "Born in Austria, Honeck received his musical training at the Academy of Music in Vienna. Many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have given his conducting a distinctive stamp. He began his career as assistant to Claudio Abbado, and as artistic leader of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. He received the prestigious European Conductor's Award in 1993 at the Zurich Opera House, and has served as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Music Director of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, and most recently as Principal Guest Conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.",
            "Manfred Honeck has received honorary doctorates from several North American universities. Most recently, he was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. The expert jury of the International Classical Music Awards selected him as \"Artist of the Year\" 2018.",

Past music directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg (1952-1976), Andre Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss Jansons (1995-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music directors was furthered in fall 2008, when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The orchestra has been at the forefront of championing new American works, and gave the first performance of Leonard Bernstein's Symphony No. 1 \"Jeremiah\" in 1944 and John Adams' Short Ride in a Fast Machine in 1986. The Pittsburgh Symphony has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and radio concerts. Its \"Pittsburgh Live!\" series with Reference Recordings has resulted in back-to-back Grammy Nominations in 2015 and 2016. As early as 1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony broadcast on the airwaves coast-to-coast and in the late 1970s it made the ground breaking PBS series \"Previn and the Pittsburgh.\" The orchestra has received increased national attention since 1982 through network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by Classical WQED-FM 89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. With a long and distinguished history of touring both domestically and overseas since 1900 \u2014 including international tours to Europe, the Far East and South America\u2014the Pittsburgh Symphony continues to be critically acclaimed as one of the world's greatest orchestras.",
            "Renowned for his distinctive interpretations, Manfred Honeck has served as Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra since the 2008/09 season. The 2017/18 season marked 10 years of this acclaimed partnership, highlighted by special commissions to commemorate this decade of successful music-making. Consistently recognized for their performances, he and the orchestra are celebrated both in Pittsburgh and abroad, and regularly perform in major music capitals and festivals.",
            "Manfred Honeck's successful work with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is extensively documented on recordings by the Reference Recordings label. All albums released by Reference Recordings \u2014 amongst them Strauss tone poems and suites, Bruckner's Symphony No. 4, Beethoven Symphonies No. 5 and 7, and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 \u2014 have received numerous rave reviews and honors. Honeck and the orchestra received two Grammy nominations for Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Symphony No. 8 and the Symphonic Suite from Jan\u00e1\u010dek's opera Jen\u016ffa, conceptualized by the artist himself, as well as for Bruckner's Symphony No. 4. In January 2018, they were honored with the Grammy Award for \"Best Orchestral Performance\" for their recording of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 and Barber's Adagio for Strings.",
            "As a guest conductor, Honeck has worked with the world's leading orchestras including the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome, and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted the New York Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony.

            "Born in Austria, Honeck received his musical training at the Academy of Music in Vienna. Many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have given his conducting a distinctive stamp. He began his career as assistant to Claudio Abbado, and as artistic leader of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. He received the prestigious European Conductor's Award in 1993 at the Zurich Opera House, and has served as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Music Director of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, and most recently as Principal Guest Conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.",

This tradition of outstanding international music directors was furthered in fall 2008, when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The orchestra has been at the forefront of championing new American works and gave the first performance of Leonard Bernstein's Symphony No. 1 \"Jeremiah\" in 1944 and John Adams' Short Ride in a Fast Machine in 1986. The Pittsburgh Symphony has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and radio concerts. Its \"Pittsburgh Live!\" series with Reference Recordings has resulted in back-to-back Grammy Nominations in 2015 and 2016.

            "Over the last quarter century,MANFRED HONECKhas firmly established himself as one of the world's leading conductors, renowned for his distinctive interpretations and arrangements of a wide-range of repertoire. For more than a decade, Honeck has served as Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, continuing a great legacy of music-making that is celebrated at home, abroad and on recordings, including the 2018 Grammy Award for Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 and Barber's Adagio for Strings. Since 2008, Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra have served as cultural ambassadors for the city as one of the most frequently toured American orchestras. In addition to performing at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, the orchestra regularly performs in major European music capitals and at leading festivals such as the Beethovenfest Bonn, BBC Proms, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Musik Festival, Grafenegg Festival and the Salzburg Festival, and continues a close relationship with the Musikverein in Vienna. The PSO and Honeck return to Lincoln Center in May 2019 and their next European tour takes place in fall 2019. Under Honeck's leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, he instituted a new initiative to preserve the orchestra's celebrated sound, resulting in more than a dozen recordings on the Reference and Exton labels. Together, Honeck and the PSO have recorded symphonies by Beethoven, Bruckner, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Mahler, and Tchaikovsky, as well as Strauss tone poems. They have received critical acclaim and honors from around the world, including the \"Best Orchestral Performance\" Grammy Award in 2018, along with two other Grammy nominations. Honeck has conceived of and conducted several large-scale or operatic works as semi-staged productions for the concert hall, including Handel's Messiah, Haydn's The Creation, and later this season in Pittsburgh he will lead performances of Berlioz's The Damnation of Faust. Beyond the podium, he has conceptualized and arranged a number of staged works into symphonic \"Fantasies\" or \"Suites,\" among them Jan\u00e1\u010dek's Jen\u016ffa (Grammy nominated), Strauss's Elektra, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Rusalka, and Tchaikovsky's ballet Sleeping Beauty, which he frequently programs on concerts with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, at home and on tour, as well as with orchestras throughout the United States and abroad.",
            "As a guest conductor, Honeck is a regular guest with all of the major American orchestras, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco. He continues to appear in the world's leading concert halls and festivals, including the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berliner Philharmoniker, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome, Vienna Philharmonic, and the Verbier Festival. He served as Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart from 2007 to 2011, and has led operatic performances at Komische Oper Berlin, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, Salzburg Festival, Semperoper Dresden and the White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg, Russia. Born in Austria, Honeck received his musical training at the Academy of Music in Vienna. He was a member of the viola section of the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra for eight years. Transitioning to conducting, he began his career as an assistant to Claudio Abbado, and as artistic leader of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. He received the prestigious European Conductor's Award in 1993 at the Zurich Opera House, and has served as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Music Director of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, and most recently as Principal Guest Conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. Honeck also has served as Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for more than twenty years.Manfred Honeck has received honorary doctorates from several North American universities. Most recently, he was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. An international jury of critics selected him as the International Classical Music Awards \"Artist of the Year\" 2018.",
            "ThePITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, known for its artistic excellence for more than 120 years, is credited with a rich history of the world's finest conductors and musicians, and a strong commitment to the Pittsburgh region and its citizens. Past music directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg (1952-1976), Andr\u00e9 Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss Jansons (1995-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music directors was furthered in fall 2008, when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The orchestra has been at the forefront of championing new American works, and gave the first performance of Leonard Bernstein's Symphony No. 1 \"Jeremiah\" in 1944 and John Adams' Short Ride in a Fast Machine in 1986. The Pittsburgh Symphony has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and radio concerts. Its \"Pittsburgh Live!\" series with Reference Recordings has resulted in back-to-back Grammy Award nominations in 2015 and 2016. As early as 1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony broadcast on the airwaves coast-to-coast and in the late 1970s it made the ground breaking PBS series \"Previn and the Pittsburgh.\" The orchestra has received increased national attention since 1982 through network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by Classical WQED-FM 89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. With a long and distinguished history of touring both domestically and overseas since 1900 \u2014 including international tours to Europe, the Far East and South America\u2014the Pittsburgh Symphony continues to be critically acclaimed as one of the world's greatest orchestras.",

The world has lost a true musical legend and the symphony has lost a close and dear friend. I was so fortunate to play under his baton many times as a member of the Vienna Philharmonic and recall his gentle approach. He was humorous, friendly and a natural partner in music-making,\u201d said Manfred Honeck, Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. \u201cWhen the symphony played at Carnegie Hall, Maestro Previn came backstage to share how happy and pleased he was to hear the outstanding playing of the orchestra. My heart goes out to his family and to all of the musicians he touched over the years. He will be greatly missed.\u201d",
            "\u201cI have no doubt that I was incredibly fortunate to start my career in the United States with a bona fide genius on the podium. I had so much respect for his musical talent which went far beyond his conducting. He and I shared a love of jazz, which we discussed fairly often,\u201d said Harold Smoliar, Principal English Horn. \u201cHe had the most incredible sense of humor. Working with him was a high point of my career.\u201d",
            "Previn is widely credited for launching a new era for the symphony after his arrival in 1976. He told the Pittsburgh Symphony\u2019s former Vice-President for Artistic Planning Robert Moir, \u201cWhen I arrived for the first rehearsal, the musicians were tuning and doing the thing with the reeds and all that. And I suddenly had a moment of absolute pleasure. I thought, \u2018That\u2019s my orchestra. They\u2019re tuning for me.\u2019\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t get over it. It was so wonderful.\u201d",

He launchedPrevin and the Pittsburgh, a string of award-winning specials produced by WQED-TV, which ran for three years and became the highest-rated classical music series on PBS at the time. It showcased the diversity of the conductor\u2019s musical interests, talents and friends, including the symphony\u2019s former Principal Keyboard Patricia Prattis Jennings, and featured guest artists like John Williams, Ella Fitzgerald, Yo-Yo Ma, Stephen Sondheim and Itzhak Perlman. Composer Miklos Rosza appeared as a guest to hear the symphony play his Oscar-winning score for the movieBen-Hur.",
            "Under Previn\u2019s leadership, in 1977 the PSO signed its first recording contract in eight years. The 1980 Angel release of Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 4, conducted by Previn with soprano Elly Ameling, received a Grammy Award nomination for the year\u2019s Best Classical Recording. Previn would eventually make more than 25 recordings with the symphony. Previn\u2019s wish for a European tour was realized in 1978 (the PSO\u2019s first since 1964), playing in 13 cities as exceptional ambassadors for the city. During his time with the symphony, he composed a Concerto for Harp and Orchestra (March 2008) for Principal Harpist Gretchen Van Hoesen,and Reflectionsfor English Horn, Cello and Orchestra (1982) for Anne Martindale Williams, Principal Cello, and Harold Smoliar, Principal English Horn.",
            "After leaving the symphony, Previn returned regularly to the Heinz Hall stage (more than 20 times). Most recently, he led a subscription week in March 2012 which also included his own Triple Concerto for Trumpet, Horn, Tuba and Orchestra, written for former Principal Trumpet George Vosburgh, Principal Horn William Caballero, and Principal Tuba Craig Knox. A movement from this work was also included in a program in February 2016 as part of the symphony\u2019s 120th anniversary celebration.",

The Pittsburgh Symphony announced in January that it had raised enough to unlock the first $1.25 million of this challenge grant, but was not expecting to unlock the second $1.25 million in the 2017-18 season. The grant comes as a match to new or increased Annual Fund gifts from individuals, corporations and foundations.\u201cWe\u2019d like to thank the nearly six thousand donors who contributed more than $2.5 million in new or increased gifts, helping us to unlock this important challenge grant a year earlier than planned. These gifts allow us to continue to perform music at the highest level of artistic excellence and share the musical journey with all of Pittsburgh and its surrounding communities,\u201d said Ms. Tourangeau. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to note that there is still a lot of work left to do. Only through continued support from the community can we truly deliver on our vision of \u2018great music in every life\u2019 and maintain a robust calendar of programming that includes our Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts concerts as well as our Learning and Community Engagement programs.\u201d",
            "The Heinz Endowment Challenge grant is part of the PSO\u2019s five-year vision plan. It will be used to support the orchestra\u2019s efforts to restructure its business plan, increase earned and contributed revenue, and attain financial stability. This year, a small planned surplus will occur, but the next three years will prove to be challenging as the organization moves toward growth and long-term success.",

            "Over the last quarter century,Manfred Honeckhas firmly established himself as one of the world\u2019s leading conductors, renowned for his distinctive interpretations and arrangements of a wide-range of repertoire. For more than a decade, Honeck has served as Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, continuing a great legacy of music-making that is celebrated at home, abroad and on recordings, including the 2018 Grammy Award for Shostakovich\u2019s Symphony No. 5 and Barber\u2019s Adagio for Strings. Since 2008, Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra have served as cultural ambassadors for the city as one of the most frequently toured American orchestras. In addition to performing at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, the orchestra regularly performs in major European music capitals and at leading festivals such as the Beethovenfest Bonn, BBC Proms, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Musik Festival, Grafenegg Festival and the Salzburg Festival, and continues a close relationship with the Musikverein in Vienna. The PSO and Honeck return to Lincoln Center in May 2019 and their next European tour takes place in fall 2019. Under Honeck\u2019s leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, he instituted a new initiative to preserve the orchestra\u2019s celebrated sound, resulting in more than a dozen recordings on the Reference and Exton labels. Together, Honeck and the PSO have recorded symphonies by Beethoven, Bruckner, Dvor\u030c\u00e1k, Mahler, and Tchaikovsky, as well as Strauss tone poems. They have received critical acclaim and honors from around the world, including the \u201cBest Orchestral Performance\u201d Grammy Award in 2018, along with two other Grammy nominations. Honeck has conceived of and conducted several large-scale or operatic works as semi-staged productions for the concert hall, including Handel\u2019sMessiah, Haydn\u2019sThe Creation,and later this season in Pittsburgh he will lead performances of Berlioz\u2019sThe Damnation of Faust. Beyond the podium, he has conceptualized and arranged a number of staged works into symphonic \u201cFantasies\u201d or \u201cSuites,\u201d among them Jan\u00e1c\u030cek\u2019sJenu\u030afa(Grammy nominated), Strauss\u2019sElektra, Dvor\u030c\u00e1k\u2019sRusalka,and Tchaikovsky\u2019s balletSleeping Beauty, which he frequently programs on concerts with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, at home and on tour, as well as with orchestras throughout the United States and abroad. As a guest conductor, Honeck is a regular guest with all of the major American orchestras, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco. He continues to appear in the world\u2019s leading concert halls and festivals, including the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berliner Philharmoniker, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome, Vienna Philharmonic, and the Verbier Festival.

Born in Austria, Honeck received his musical training at the Academy of Music in Vienna. He was a member of the viola section of the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra for eight years. Transitioning to conducting, he began his career as an assistant to Claudio Abbado, and as artistic leader of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra.

Honeck also has served as Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for more than twenty years.Manfred Honeck has received honorary doctorates from several North American universities. Most recently, he was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. An international jury of critics selected him as the International Classical Music Awards \u201cArtist of the Year\u201d 2018.",

            "Sound heard through telecoils can vary from hearing aid to hearing aid and according to position in the theater. Generally, the best signal is found when you sit in the center of a row and facing toward the stage. If you need further assistance in selecting the best seats, please contact the Heinz Hall box office.",
            "If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call Heinz Hall directly at 412.392.4900.",

This hybrid SACD release was recorded in Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts, the acoustically outstanding and historic home of the orchestra.",
            "In this bold yet sensitive interpretation of Tchaikovsky\u2019s masterpiece, Manfred Honeck invites us on a journey that has, \u201cone of the most effective conclusions in all of the symphonic literature.\u201c According to Honeck\u2019s notes that accompany the music, he and the musicians explore the tension and contrasts between, \u201cdarkness and suffering, but also hope and light. At once, it is on the edge of despair\u2014depressed, hopeless, broken, melancholic and gloomy; but there is also an incredible counterpoint\u2014courageous, self-confident, joyful, optimistic, wild and blissful.\u201d Honeck situates the fourth symphony in an historical framework, revealing how the composer\u2019s own life and struggles are reflected in the music\u2014and how this context informs his own interpretation of the work on stage.",

            "In contrast with the last movement of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Symphony No. 4, Jonathan Leshnoff\u2019s Double Concerto for Clarinet and Bassoon offers lightness and buoyancy, juxtaposing the agility of the clarinet with the richness of the bassoon. In the accompanying music notes, Leshnoff says, \u201cAn important question would be how to combine and juxtapose the sprite clarinet with the heavier color of the bassoon and be sure that the bassoon\u00a0stood out from the texture.\u00a0...I discovered that there were some magical combinations that the clarinet and bassoon can make with each other. I found that the bassoon can be very plaintive and resonant in its higher register, and that mixing that sound with the timbre of the clarinet yields some remarkable qualities.\"",

            "The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra history with popular programming goes back to its early days with Victor Herbert who often programmed lighter music, including his own compositions. In the following decades, conductors brought inventive programming to Pittsburgh audiences, including introducing Pops concerts at unexpected venues like the first outdoor performance in the symphony\u2019s history at the Sky Club in West Mifflin in 1935. Pops performances were often billed as \u201clight programs and popular soloists,\u201d with guest conductors and stars of the era such as Benny Goodman, Henry Mancini, Ethel Merman, Phyllis Diller and Doc Severinsen. With the advent of the Marvin Hamlisch era, the venerable Pops series was infused with a new injection of excitement and \u201crazzle-dazzle\u201d as he welcomed memorable programs like \u201cLove Nights\u201d and \u201cProm Nights,\u201d and stars like Bernadette Peters. With the unexpected passing of Hamlisch in 2012, the symphony\u2019s Pops programming continued under the baton of leading guest conductors, welcoming star guest artists like Chris Botti.",

            "PITTSBURGH, PA\u2014The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra today released the following  statement on the news of the passing of Maestro Mariss Jansons, Music Director  of the orchestra from 1997-2004.",
            "\u201cOur hearts are heavy and saddened with the passing of Maestro  Mariss Jansons, a great and beloved Music Director for the Pittsburgh Symphony  Orchestra. He was an exceptional leader who brought the orchestra into the 21st  century with astonishing music not only at Heinz Hall, but at halls throughout  the world on tour,\u201d said Melia Tourangeau, President and CEO of the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra. \u201cWe are compelled to reflect on his passion for music  making and his call to, \u2018perform each night as if you think it is your last.\u2019  We offer our deepest sympathy to his wife Irina and their family.\u201d",
            "\"I was so very sad to learn this morning of  the passing\u00a0of our beloved former Pittsburgh\u00a0Symphony\u00a0Orchestra  Music Director, Mariss Jansons.\u00a0What a deep loss\u00a0this is for  the\u00a0entire\u00a0music world, which loses one of its greatest artists,  but\u00a0especially for Pittsburgh,\u201d said Manfred Honeck, Music Director of the  Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.\u00a0\u201cWe will cherish the  many\u00a0unforgettable\u00a0concerts that\u00a0Mariss\u00a0led, his  extraordinary artistry\u00a0and beautiful humanity.\u00a0I\u00a0personally have  lost a\u00a0dear friend and he\u00a0will be greatly missed by all.\u00a0Our  thoughts,\u00a0prayers and deepest condolences\u00a0are with his wife,  Irina,\u00a0and the entire\u00a0family.\"",
            "At the Pittsburgh Symphony concert this afternoon  at Heinz Hall, Honeck addressed the audience with a remembrance of Jansons, and  then led the orchestra in a performance of the SchubertLitanei auf  das\u00a0Fest Aller Seelen, D. 343in honor of Jansons, followed by  a moment of silence.",
            "On April 10, 1995, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra announced the  appointment of Mariss Jansons as the eighth Music Director of the orchestra, to  succeed Lorin Maazel. The musical partnership lasted through the 2003-2004  season. At the time of his appointment, Jansons\u2019 performances and recordings  with the Oslo Philharmonic, the St. Petersburg (formerly the Leningrad)  Philharmonic Orchestra, and the London Philharmonic led the London Times to  call him \"one of the most exciting conductors in the world today.\"  Jansons later recalled, \u201cI felt it was already a good orchestra with wonderful  players, and very well organized and managed. And, although I was music  conductor before in the eastern part of Europe, I didn\u2019t have experience as  music director in America. Therefore, I was thinking, for these two reasons it  would be great for me to go to America. And, I must tell you that I was  absolutely right. Because this was one of my most wonderful times in my life.  And the community is unbelievably nice.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one will forget his concert with the orchestra after September  11th. After Mariss' plane was diverted en route here for the gala  concert. He arrived just before the concert, and, without having ever conducted  the piece, led the orchestra in Aaron Copland\u2019sFanfare  for the Common Man,\u201d said Tom Todd, board member of the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra and chair of the board at that time. \u201cThe transformation of  the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Mariss was striking.\u201d",

The project was made possible by a $10,000 grant from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC), which was matched by the Pittsburgh Symphony. The digitization process was led by The MediaPreserve, an internationally recognized digitization company, located in suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which carefully treated and transferred the recordings from delicate reels to digital audio files.",

            "The importance of saving the concert recordings from possible irretrievable deterioration became clear as Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra archivist Carolyn Friedrich discovered that, according to the Library of Congress, tapes of their format and age needed to be digitized within the next eight years. A majority of the recordings were captured on Scotch/3M 227 and Ampex 406 tapes. The formula used in manufacturing these tapes has been documented as particularly susceptible to \u201csticky-shed syndrome,\u201d or binder hydrolysis, making the need for professional digitization with the ability to temporarily reverse the hydrolysis imperative. The degradation of the reels from the \u201csticky-shed\u201d material, combined with decades of previous handling and overlooked storage, posed a risk for permanent loss of the recordings.",

            "Andr\u00e9 Previn is widely credited for launching a new era for the Pittsburgh Symphony after his arrival in 1976. He told the Pittsburgh Symphony\u2019s former Vice-President for Artistic Planning Robert Moir, \u201cWhen I arrived for the first rehearsal, the musicians were tuning and doing the thing with the reeds and all that. And I suddenly had a moment of absolute pleasure. I thought, \u2018That\u2019s my orchestra. They\u2019re tuning for me.\u2019\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t get over it. It was so wonderful.\u201d",
            "Previn\u2019s direction brought sold-out houses, the addition of a Thursday night series and a new recording series. He launchedPrevin and the Pittsburgh, a string of award-winning specials produced by WQED-TV, which ran for three years and became the highest-rated classical music series on PBS at the time.",
            "Under Previn\u2019s leadership, in 1977 the PSO signed its first recording contract in eight years. The 1980 Angel release of Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 4, conducted by Previn with soprano Elly Ameling, received a GRAMMY\u00ae\u00a0Award nomination for the year\u2019s Best Classical Orchestra Recording. Previn would eventually make more than 25 recordings with the symphony. Previn\u2019s wish for a European tour was realized in 1978 (the Pittsburgh Symphony\u2019s first since 1964), playing in 13 cities as exceptional ambassadors for the city. During his time with the symphony, he composed a Concerto for Harp and Orchestra\u00a0for Gretchen Van Hoesen, principal harp, and Reflections\u00a0for English Horn, Cello and Orchestra for Anne Martindale Williams, principal cello, and Harold Smoliar, former principal English horn.",
            "After leaving the Pittsburgh Symphony, Andr\u00e9 Previn returned regularly to the Heinz Hall stage (more than 20 times). His last subscription week was in March 2012 which also included his own Triple Concerto for Trumpet, Horn, Tuba and Orchestra, written for former principal trumpet George Vosburgh, principal horn William Caballero, and principal tuba Craig Knox.

A discussion then ensued with the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership to collaborate on the opportunity to use that space to create an art installation inspired by the orchestra, music and other performing arts that take place at Heinz Hall, in the middle of the Cultural District.",
            "\u201cPublic art plays such a vital role in delivering unique experiences in cities around the world, creating opportunities for people to connect with something unique and inspiring,\u201d said Jeremy Waldrup, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. \u201cMikael has created beautiful artwork that embodies the energy and beauty of the Symphony, as well as providing a stunning addition to Downtown Pittsburgh\u2019s Cultural District. Many thanks and congratulations to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Mikael Owunna for sharing this extraordinary work with our city.\u201d",
            "From start to finish, the commissioning to installation process took about five months to complete. The Pittsburgh Symphony and the PDP formed a working group of Pittsburgh Symphony and PDP leadership, musicians, and community leaders. Pittsburgh arts leader Renee Piechowki (who founded the Office of Public Art in Pittsburgh in 2005 and served as director until 2017) guided the group through an invitational application process seeking diverse artists who could best represent the relationship between the broader community and the Orchestra\u2019s vision of \u201cgreat music in everyday life.\u201d After a review of several artists, the committee chose Mikael Owunna to create a piece of art to draw people in to be a part of the vitality of the Hall, and to evoke the special relationship that exists between music, the Orchestra and the community.",
            "Upon receiving the commission, Owunna presented his work to Pittsburgh Symphony musicians, staff, and board and solicited feedback through an online survey. With this feedback, he then contracted Marques Redd to serve as the model for the commission. Over two weeks, Owunna constructed and painted a fluorescent set with glowing strings in his studio. On the day of Redd\u2019s photoshoot, he meticulously hand-painted Redd\u2019s body with fluorescent paints that only glow under ultraviolet light. Using an ultraviolet flash that he constructed with his engineering background, Owunna photographed Redd in total darkness as Redd interacted with the glowing set and strings. With each click of Owunna\u2019s shutter, a beam of ultraviolet light was emitted that for a fraction of a second illuminated the tableau of Igbo myth captured in \u201cPlaying the Cosmic Strings.\u201d",
            "This mural was installed in October 2021 as part of the 50th anniversary season of Heinz Hall as the home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

            "Inspired byUwa Okoso(West African Igbo String-Wave cosmology), the imagePlaying the Cosmic Stringsexplores the origins of the universe and music. In this model, the universe emerges out of a Primordial Androgynous Blackness. A portion of this Blackness -Atu Chukwu(the divine mind-force or dark energy) - manifests in the guise ofUdudo-Okwa-Nka(a sacred spider), who spinsEte Ofu(the first cosmic cotton/dark matter) intoAkwa Ete(a grand spiral-string egg). This egg subsequently breaks to formEte Oghele(a web of infinite string patterns or particles). The Cosmic Spider is a rich, multidimensional symbol. From one viewpoint, it is an ancient Igbo mnemonic metaphor for the Milky Way Galaxy, which possesses the shape of a gigantic spider when viewed from an aerial position, and its strings are a metaphor for the vibrating loops of energy that form the physical structure of the world. This cosmology is presented in miniature form in the recreational game (meaning both a pleasurable diversion and a \u201cre-creation,\u201d repetition of creation) ofIkpa Owu Aka(string hand game), in which children make angular loops of string around their fingers. In this way, they learn how to mimic and invoke the vibrating strings that form the basic energy patterns of everything from the most distant stars to the smallest atoms. Arising from this cosmology and its integration into everyday life, music in the Igbo sensibility is understood as all of the sonic harmonies emanating from the subtle, spirit vibrations of the infinite strings everywhere in creation, including those consciously produced by human beings.",

Looming large on Heinz Hall over passersby below, he reaches out and beckons all viewers to reach back. To join the game, everyone must strive to penetrate into the higher realms of creation, which can only be reached through pure energy and pure spirit sound. Just as the Creator does, we must learn to play the cosmic strings.",

Their first recording, \u201cBreaking the Silence,\u201d on the Naxos label, features music by Jewish composers who suffered exile and execution at the hand of the Nazis. Currently, the Quartet is broadening its scope, exploring other marginalized composers, who have been overlooked and denied the acclaim they deserve. Before moving to Pittsburgh, Orchard was a member of the world-renowned Lark Quartet and recorded extensively under the Arabesque label during her eight-year tenure. Her talent was recognized with an invitation from famed composer/conductor, Marvin Hamlisch, performing with Hamlisch as a guest of honor at the Kuwaiti embassy. As a child in Canada, Orchard learned to play the fiddle and has used these diverse talents, collaborating with conductor Byron Stripling and singer songwriter, Andrew Lipke.",

Known for its artistic excellence for nearly 125 years, past music directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg (1952-1976), Andr\u00e9 Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss Jansons (1997-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music directors was continued in fall 2008, when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. The Pittsburgh Symphony is continually at the forefront of championing new American works. They premiered Leonard Bernstein\u2019s Symphony No. 1 \u201cJeremiah\u201d in 1944, John Adams\u2019Short Ride in a Fast Machinein1986, and Mason Bates\u2019Resurrexitin 2018 to celebrate Manfred Honeck\u2019s 60th birthday. The orchestra has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and live radio broadcasts. Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra have received multiple GRAMMY nominations for Best Orchestral Performance, taking home the award in 2018 for their recording of Shostakovich: Symphony No. 5; Barber: Adagio. As early as1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony has been broadcasted on the radio. Since 1982, the orchestra has received increased attention through national network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by ClassicalWQED-FM89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Lauded as the Pittsburgh region\u2019s international cultural ambassador, in 2019 the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under the leadership of Music Director Manfred Honeck, embarked on an extensive tour of Europe, the 25th in orchestra history.",

The performance promises to transcend the audience to a place where they are the ink, the orchestra is the pen, and the stage is the paper,\u201c said Harvey \u201cFrzy\u201d Daniels . \u201cIt's poignant that this announcement comes while we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the birth of hip-hop that is now a world sensation.

The study was conducted by a respected international\n      consulting firm during the Orchestra\u2019s Fiscal Year 2023/24 Season. Driven\n      by a commitment to unparalleled live musical experiences, community\n      collaborations, and educational programming, the study reveals the PSO\u2019s\n      impact beyond its rich history and legacy of artistic excellence and\n      concludes that the Pittsburgh Symphony generates $125 million in economic\n      impact and sustains 1900 jobs annually.",
            "With an annual budget of $33 million, PSO\u2019s $125 million in regional\n      impact equates to an almost 4:1 return on each dollar spent (higher than\n      comparable metropolitan orchestras included in the study). The research\n      findings also concluded that PSO attracts more visitors to Pittsburgh\u2019s\n      Cultural District than all other arts producing organizations combined.\n      \u201cAs Pittsburgh\u2019s cultural ambassador around the world, it\u2019s important to\n      note that this four-fold return extends well beyond our city and region,\u201d\n      saidMarty Bates, Executive VP and COO, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.\u201cPSO European tours, internationally acclaimed recordings, and live radio\n      streams showcase Pittsburgh\u2019s excellence to audiences far beyond our city.\n      That\u2019s a powerful return on investment for our patrons, donors, business\n      partners, and the community-at-large.\u201d",
            "Additionally, the study highlighted PSO\u2019s educational impact, with\n      PSO-affiliated musicians having taught in over 75 higher education\n      institutions worldwide and currently supporting $12 million in local\n      higher education spending impact. PSO musicians also mentor and teach\n      students in youth performance groups and community schools, resulting in\n      over $1.3 million in music-learning spend and contributing to students'\n      success in the classroom.",
            "\u201cAs the needs and expectations of society evolve, great orchestras like\n      the Pittsburgh Symphony are constantly innovating to engage current and\n      new audiences, to elevate the music learning ecosystem, and to enrich\n      every life with great music. This study clearly shows the value of that\n      innovation,\u201d saidMelia Tournageau, President & CEO, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.\u201cI couldn\u2019t be prouder of the sizeable economic and cultural impact that\n      PSO generates each year by bringing the power of live music to 250,000\n      individuals, as well as the significant educational impact associated with\n      PSO-affiliated musicians teaching and mentoring the next generation of\n      musicians and music-lovers.\u201d",
            "After concluding that the Orchestra is responsible for $125 million in spending across Pittsburgh \n        and the region, the report also determined that PSO sustains 1900 jobs annually in the Pittsburgh MSA, almost 7 times its direct base of 275 employees. PSO also attracts and retains 32% of the region\u2019s resident, full-time professional performing artists \u2014 more than any other Pittsburgh arts producing organization.",
            "\u201cAlthough many Pittsburghers value Pittsburgh Symphony\u2019s musical significance, our economic and educational impacts are undeniable,\u201d addedAnthony L. Bucci, Board Chair, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and Chairman, 9Rooftops.\u201cPittsburgh Symphony plays a vital role in our community on stage and off: as an economic engine for job creation and retention, through patron spend on PSO and Heinz Hall concerts, and through the passionate work of PSO musicians who contribute to the educational impact and economic vitality of our city and region.\u201d",

I seek to combine the sharp and earnest energy of the Pittsburgh Symphony, one of the best in the world, with an original understanding of the music. The result is not a \u2018return\u2019 to some old ideal, but a new way forward \u2014 a fresh authenticity \u2014 which may even register as irreverent, but which is really truer to the music, and honors it.",

            "PITTSBURGH AND POPSThe Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra history with popular programming goes back to its early days with Victor Herbert who often programmed lighter music, including his own compositions. In the following decades, conductors brought inventive programming to Pittsburgh audiences, including introducing Pops concerts at unexpected venues like the first outdoor performance in the symphony\u2019s history at the Sky Club in West Mifflin in 1935. Pops performances were often billed as \u201clight programs and popular soloists,\u201d with guest conductors and stars of the era such as Benny Goodman, Henry Mancini, Ethel Merman, Phyllis Diller and Doc Severinsen. With the advent of the Marvin Hamlisch era, the venerable Pops series was infused with a new injection of excitement and \u201crazzle-dazzle\u201d as he welcomed memorable programs like \u201cLove Nights\u201d and \u201cProm Nights,\u201d and stars like Bernadette Peters. With the unexpected passing of Hamlisch in 2012, the symphony\u2019s Pops programming continued under the baton of leading guest conductors, welcoming star guest artists like Chris Botti. In 2020, Pittsburgh Symphony appointedByron Striplingas Principal Conductor for PNC Pops.",

            "Over the last  quarter century,MANFRED HONECKhas firmly established himself as one of  the world's leading conductors, renowned for his distinctive interpretations  and arrangements of a wide-range of repertoire. For more than a decade, Honeck  has served as Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, continuing a  great legacy of music-making that is celebrated at home, abroad and on  recordings, including the 2018 Grammy Award for Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5  and Barber's Adagio for Strings. Since 2008, Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra have served as cultural ambassadors for the city as one of  the most frequently toured American orchestras. In addition to performing at  Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, the orchestra regularly performs  in major European music capitals and at leading festivals such as the  Beethovenfest Bonn, BBC Proms, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau  Musik Festival, Grafenegg Festival and the Salzburg Festival, and continues a  close relationship with the Musikverein in Vienna. The PSO and Honeck return to  Lincoln Center in May 2019 and their next European tour takes place in fall  2019. Under Honeck's leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, he instituted a new  initiative to preserve the orchestra's celebrated sound, resulting in more than  a dozen recordings on the Reference and Exton labels. Together, Honeck and the  PSO have recorded symphonies by Beethoven, Bruckner, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Mahler, and  Tchaikovsky, as well as Strauss tone poems. They have received critical acclaim  and honors from around the world, including the \"Best Orchestral  Performance\" Grammy Award in 2018, along with two other Grammy  nominations. Honeck has conceived of and conducted several large-scale or  operatic works as semi-staged productions for the concert hall, including Handel's  Messiah, Haydn's The Creation, and later this season in Pittsburgh he will lead  performances of Berlioz's The Damnation of Faust. Beyond the podium, he has  conceptualized and arranged a number of staged works into symphonic  \"Fantasies\" or \"Suites,\" among them Jan\u00e1\u010dek's Jen\u016ffa  (Grammy nominated), Strauss's Elektra, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Rusalka, and Tchaikovsky's ballet  Sleeping Beauty, which he frequently programs on concerts with the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra, at home and on tour, as well as with orchestras throughout  the United States and abroad.",
            "As a guest  conductor, Honeck is a regular guest with all of the major American orchestras,  including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and  San Francisco. He continues to appear in the world's leading concert halls and  festivals, including the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berliner  Philharmoniker, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Royal  Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris,  Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome, Vienna Philharmonic, and the Verbier Festival.  He served as Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart from 2007 to 2011, and  has led operatic performances at Komische Oper Berlin, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie in  Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, Salzburg Festival, Semperoper Dresden and  the White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg, Russia. Born in Austria, Honeck  received his musical training at the Academy of Music in Vienna. He was a  member of the viola section of the ViennaPhilharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra for eight years. Transitioning to  conducting, he began his career as an assistant to Claudio Abbado, and as  artistic leader of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. He received the prestigious  European Conductor's Award in 1993 at the Zurich Opera House, and has served as  Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of  the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Music Director of the Swedish Radio Symphony  Orchestra, and most recently as Principal Guest Conductor of the Czech  Philharmonic Orchestra. Honeck also has served as Artistic Director of the  International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for more than twenty years.Manfred  Honeck has received honorary doctorates from several North American  universities. Most recently, he was awarded the honorary title of Professor by  the Austrian Federal President. An international jury of critics selected him  as the International Classical Music Awards \"Artist of the Year\"  2018.",
            "The 2018 GRAMMY  Award-winningPITTSBURGH SYMPHONY  ORCHESTRA, known for its artistic excellence for more than 120 years, is  credited with a rich history of the world's finest conductors and musicians,  and a strong commitment to the Pittsburgh region and its citizens. Past music  directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg  (1952-1976), Andre Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss  Jansons (1995-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music  directors was furthered in fall 2008, when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck  became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The orchestra has been at the  forefront of championing new American works and gave the first performance of  Leonard Bernstein's Symphony No. 1 \"Jeremiah\" in 1944 and John Adams'  Short Ride in a Fast Machine in 1986. The Pittsburgh Symphony has a long and  illustrious history in the areas of recordings and radio concerts. Its  \"Pittsburgh Live!\" series with Reference Recordings has resulted in  back-to-back Grammy Nominations in 2015 and 2016. As early as 1936, the  Pittsburgh Symphony broadcast on the airwaves coast-to-coast and in the late  1970s it made the ground-breaking PBS series \"Previn and the  Pittsburgh.\" The orchestra has received increased national attention since  1982 through network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced  by Classical WQED-FM 89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra. With a long and distinguished history of touring both  domestically and overseas since 1900 \u2014 including international tours to Europe,  the Far East and South America\u2014the Pittsburgh Symphony continues to be  critically acclaimed as one of the world's greatest orchestras.",

The statement reflects on her earliest memories of music, but it speaks to a larger truth about this gifted artist: Life and music have always been joined as she lives out her life passion every day.",

Yet the conventional narrative does not capture the more complete picture of Orchard, who has a heartfelt love for the beauty of music and a sense of purpose as she brings it to life.",
            "Orchard came to the violin as a young child and grew rapidly. Her early success led to admission into the Curtis Institute of Music and The Juilliard School, where she honed the skills that would lead to a professional career.",

            "From her conservatory studies, Orchard entered her first professional position as a member of the Lark Quartet. She played with Lark for eight years, from 1993-2001 and while there began a recording career that continues to this day.",
            "Now a member of the Pittsburgh Symphony first violin section, Orchard channels her artistic endeavors through many avenues. In 2015, she and three other PSO musicians formed the Clarion Quartet which commits itself to performance and awareness of composers whose lives and careers were destroyed through the atrocities of WWII. These composers, deemed degenerate by the Nazi party have been neglected and largely forgotten since the war. The Clarion Quartet\u2019s mission is to break the silence and restore this music to its rightful place on the stages of today. Their recording of three such composers came out in 2018 and is available on Naxos.",
            "Orchard\u2019s recording work also includes partnering with pianist Igor Kraevsky on the music of Paul Juon, a Russian composer whose works were also, though not through war, neglected and largely unknown. Orchard and Kraevsky\u2019s work together has spanned fifteen plus years, performing the world premiere of Paul Juon\u2019s Triple concerto in Moscow Conservatory Hall and producing many recordings including two world premieres entitled Weisse Nachte and Bagatellen.",
            "Orchard expresses a sincere and humble gratitude for having had the opportunity in her life to play with great musicians and for appreciative audiences, which is the fulfillment of a life mission.",
            "As for how she articulates that personal mission, she says without hesitation: \u201cTo always have passion about the music, and to never stop playing.\u201d",

            "In 1898, a man steeped in popular music was chosen to lead the Orchestra. Victor Herbert was best known as a man of the theater and had composed a number of comic operas. A flamboyant conductor, he inspired musicians and audiences alike with his boundless enthusiasm.",
            "\"We need not be ashamedto take this orchestra to New York. ... I think it is the best orchestra, with the exception of possibly the Boston Symphony, in the United States.... I would like just to see our audience go to New York with the orchestra. It would most certainly create a most favorable impression.\" - Andr\u00e9w Carnegie, as quoted in thePittsburgh Post, November 18, 1899\"",
            "In its second season under Victor Herbert, the Orchestra received an invitation to perform two concerts at Carnegie Hall in NewYork City. Andr\u00e9w Carnegie agreed to finance the trip.",
            "The critics disagreed on Herbert, but ticket sales soared. Audiences flocked to hear the charismatic Irishman conduct a varied repertoire that included many of his own most popular works.",
            "\"How Pittsburg intelligencecould ever select this clever bandmaster as its symphony director passes comprehension, unless indeed the people there never really appreciated the true significance of the artistic movement a permanent symphonic orchestra represents.\" -Musical Courier,July 17, 1901",
            "\"The discipline of the playersis perfect. Their work plainly evidences arduous training under an experienced master of the orchestra, whose slightest look or gesture evokes instant response.\"-Pittsburgh Dispatch",
            "Despite lavish praise from critics and a growing national reputation, hard times lay ahead for the Orchestra. A global panic in 1907 had an immediate impact on the ability and the resolve of the wealthy to support cultural organizations throughout the country. The city of Pittsburgh proved to be no exception.",
            "To make matters worse, Paur's practice of hiring European musicians damaged relations with local musicians to the point where half of the orchestra's members refused to renew their contracts for the 1908-09 season. Subscriptions declined in the wake of the controversy.",
            "By 1910 the Orchestra's future was in immediate jeopardy. The original guarantors had conceived of the orchestra as a self-sustaining institution. In reality they spent over $1 million to subsidize the organization in its first 15 years. A new approach was clearly needed and a plan was developed to raise an endowment. When insufficient funds were forthcoming, the orchestra canceled its upcoming season. No one suspected that 16 years would pass before Pittsburgh could resurrect its symphony orchestra.",
            "\"A crisis has been reachedin the differences between Conductor Emil Paur, of the Pittsburg Orchestra, and the organized musicians of America.",
            "So strained have matters become that President Joseph Weber, of the National Federation of Musicians, has sent Conductor Paur an ultimatum to the effect that if he persists in trying to bring musicians from Europe to fill existing vacancies in the Pittsburg Orchestra, every player in the big musical organization will be called out, and not allowed to play a note under Paur's leadership.\"\u00a0-Pittsburg Press, July 19, 1907",

            "The Orchestra gave a concert in Columbus, Ohio on Wednesday night. The music critic of the Ohio State Journal, in reporting the concert, said in part: '...What a lasting shame it would be to Pittsburg, the home of the wealthy, to lose such a superb organization for the lack of a few dollars.'\" -Pittsburg Press, March 16, 1910",
            "It took sixteen years, but on May 2, 1926, the dream of a new Pittsburgh Orchestra finally became reality. The players took part in fourteen unpaid rehearsals and contributed $25 each to sponsor a free public concert of the new Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.",
            "Following the newly restructured Orchestra's successful debut, the Symphony Society organized a Sunday concert series that began on April 24, 1927. Sunday was chosen because most of the player were under contract with theater orchestras during the week.",
            "The following Monday, nine board members were arrested for violating the Pennsylvania Blue Laws, which forbade secular music-making on the Sabbath. The publicity didn't hurt the PSO. The board's fight to keep the series alive whetted the public's appetite for symphony concerts.",
            "\"The Orchestra is composedof players about town, who are so sincere in their purpose of founding a symphony orchestra that they gave their time for rehearsals and their services for last night's concert to prove possibilities with material at hand. In a few months' time these good men have accomplished wonders under Elias Breeskin, the concertmaster, and only at the last moment called in Richard Hageman, a well known Metropolitan conductor, to put the finishing touches on their playing.\" -Gazette Times, May 3, 1926",
            "In 1930, Antonio Modarelli assumed his post as the Music Director of the Orchestra. He had spent the previous eight years in Berlin composing and conducting, and was the only American composer to be elected to the prestigious \"Society of German Composers.\" He was Music Director until 1937, but he never quite won the whole-hearted acceptance of Pittsburgh audiences, in part because he was a local boy, born in nearby Braddock.",
            "In 1936, the Symphony's concerts are broadcast nationally for the first time. Pittsburgh Plate Glass sponsors 26 programs, which are carried over every major radio station east of Denver.",
            "Several internationally known guest conductors were invited to lead the Orchestra during the 1937-38 season, among them Carlos Chavez, Eugene Goossens, and Fritz Reiner.",
            "In 1937, the PSO engaged renowned conductor Otto Klemperer to reorganize and expand the Orchestra. A born teacher, he is credited with turning the orchestra into a power to be reckoned with in just six weeks.",
            "\"The entire orchestrahas already acquired a homogeneity of tone that seems hardly possible in so short a life. Dr. Klemperer calls it a baby of three weeks but it is a lusty infant and its song promises sturdy manhood.\" -Pittsburgh SunTelegraph",

            "The PSO enjoyed ten prolific years with the legendary Fritz Reiner as Music Director. An uncompromising conductor, Reiner extracted precise articulation and phrasing from his players. The Orchestra's reputation grew dramatically, netting the ensemble a high-profile recording contract and an invitation to perform abroad. Several of the world's most noted composers felt privileged to have the PSO perform world premieres of their works under Reiner's authoritative direction.",
            "Reiner had a volatile temper and demanded perfection from his players. His was an extremely small beat which forced the musicians to remain alert at all times. At one rehearsal a bass player put a telescope to his eye. When he explained to Reiner that he was \"trying to find the beat,\" the conductor fired him on the spot!",
            "Women joined the Orchestra for the first time during World War II. Eighteen came aboard in 1942 and twenty-four more in 1944.",
            "Reiner left the Orchestra in 1948 to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and went on to conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. From 1948 to 1952, the Orchestra played under a succession of distinguished guest conductors. These included Leopold Stokowski, Leonard Bernstein, Erich Leinsdorf, Charles Munch, Paul Paray, and Victor de Sabata.",
            "The best conducting techniqueis that which achieves the maximum musical result with the minimum effort. The only general rule is to infuse all gestures with precision, clarity, and vitality. -Fritz Reiner",

            "Leonard Bernstein on Reiner, 1989:\"He was a genius, apart from all other conductors I've ever known. He was tyrannical, he was cruel, he was bitter, he was ruthless in his treatment of us if we didn't know what was happening. His standards were incredibly high, and I bless him for it.\"",
            "Fritz Reiner peered over his spectaclesat the 18 women in the Pittsburgh Symphony -which boasts more femininity than any other major orchestra in the country - and remarked whimsically that he ought to call them \"Fritz Reiner and his All-Girl Orchestra.\" The Pittsburgh Symphony conductor said he didn't mind having so many women in the orchestra. In fact, he said he liked it very much. \"It's much easier to get along with many women than with one,\" he philosophized. -Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 9, 1942",
            "In its 23 years under the direction of William Steinberg, the PSO remained a superb ensemble and developed an eager and devoted following. By 1961, audiences had increased 250 percent. What's more, in the five preceding years, the PSO was the only American orchestra to sell out all its concerts by season tickets.",
            "Steinberg's talents had long been recognized by some of the world's greatest conductors. As a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Otto Klemperer, Steinberg had a glamorous career in his homeland of Germany before fleeing the Nazis in 1936. Arturo Toscanini invited him to organize the newly formed Palestine Orchestra in Tel Aviv (today's Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) and, in 1937, to become his associate conductor at the NBC Orchestra. Steinberg went on to direct the Buffalo Philharmonic before becoming Music Director of the PSO in 1952. The Boston Symphony Orchestra engaged him as Music Director from 1969 to 1972, a post he held concurrently with his PSO Music Directorship.",
            "On August 14, 1964, the PSO embarked on an 11-week, 24,000 mile tour to 14 nations in Europe and the Near East. Sponsored by the U.S. State Department, the tour earned the Smoky city a reputation for producing more than steel and elevated the image of American culture abroad.",
            "One must always respect the characterof the music and never try to grow lush foliage in a well tempered English garden. -William Steinberg",
            "Steinberg conducted this complex workwith amazing control, exacting the fullest possible interest from the score. -Pittsburgh Press, January 9, 1954",
            "Some of the Orchestra's best recordings were made in the Syria Mosque where the PSO performed from 1926 until 1971. The building was torn down in 1992 to the dismay of many who had attended concerts there.",
            "The opening of Heinz Hall on September 10, 1971 marked the completion of an 11-year campaign, initiated by Henry J. Heinz II. The resplendent concert hall stands as a testimonial to the civic spirit that has supported Pittsburgh's cultural organizations since the turn of the century.",
            "At the time of Steinberg's death in 1978, his stepson remembered him with these words inMusic Journal:\"He moved to Pittsburgh in 1952. His career reached its zenith there. He built the Orchestra into an instrument totally sensitive to his will, his touch. He loved them like his children, and criticized them as such. For twenty-five years he made beautiful music with that orchestra. Even when their sound was not as good as that of greater ensembles, they played for him beyond their capacities. He was desolate when he retired, he did not want to let go.\"",
            "In addition to his considerable talents as a conductor, Andr\u00e9 Previn brought to the PSO his virtuosity at the piano and a musical sensibility shaped in Hollywood. He began studying piano in his native Berlin at the age of six before the rise of the Nazi regime sent his family first to Paris and later to Los Angeles. In his teenage years he began composing, arranging and conducting film scores. The four-time Academy Award Winner developed an equally successful career as a Jazz pianist before turning to conducting in 1960. In 1968 he was appointed Principal Conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. He held that post until 1979, having already assumed the Music Directorship of the PSO in 1976.",
            "Previn often brought jazz to the concert hall. In February 1977, the PSO and Previn made their national debut on PBS with eight specials, \"Previn and the Pittsburgh.\" Alcoa sponsored the award-winning series, which ran for three years.",
            "The choice of Previnis a great one. He is a man not afraid of mixing new works with old and his shaping of programs for the orchestra should offer some of the best variety seen here in years. -Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 21, 1974",
            "After the two-hour, intensively experienced concert,one is ready to believe that the Pittsburgh Symphony musicians can play anything: rococo, classical, late romantic and modern music with the same animated accuracy. -Der Tagesspiegel, Berlin",
            "Long acknowledged to be one of America's great orchestras, the PSO developed an unrivaled international following during its years under Lorin Maazel. The Orchestra gained further stature as Maazel led tours of Europe, Asia, and the Americas, added first-rank players to vital positions, and programmed season-long retrospectives that appealed to audiences and critics alike.",
            "Following Previn's departure in 1984, Maazel agreed to act as Music Consultant while the Orchestra sought a permanent Music Director. He was offered and accepted that position in 1988, having already dazzled the world and won the hearts of the players in the course of numerous guest appearances and three acclaimed tours.",
            "For Maazel, the journey back to Pittsburgh was a homecoming. His family settled here while he was still a young child so he could continue to study with his conducting teacher, Vladimir Bakaleinikov, who had become Associate Conductor of the PSO in 1939.",
            "Maazel later joined the Orchestra as a violinist and apprentice conductor while studying at the University of Pittsburgh. His career soon took him to Europe where in 1960 he became the first American invited to direct at the Bayreuth Festival. He went on to become Music Director of the Deutsche Oper, The Cleveland Orchestra, the Orchestre National de France, and the Vienna Opera before returning to Pittsburgh. In 1993 he assumed an additional music directorship, as artistic head of the Symphony Orchestra of the Bavarian Radio in Munich.",
            "The musical legacy of Maazel's artistic leadership is an Orchestra built upon the multifaceted talents of virtuosic players. For years to come, the high artistic standards inspired by this greatest of living American conductors will be upheld within the Orchestra.",
            "Also under Maestro Maazel's direction, the PSO commissioned several works to showcase principal players. The first was the Benjamin Lees Hom Concerto, which premiered on May 14,1992 and was performed later that year on the PSO's European tour by William Caballero.

            "The Orchestra has produced many fine compact discs with Maazel, among them a complete cycle devoted to the works of Sibelius. The PSO won a Grammy award for its 1992 recording with Yo-Yo Ma of works for cello and orchestra.",

            "Beginning in 1990, Maazel gave audiences the chance to gain a deeper appreciation of some of the world's great composers with seasonal retrospectives featuring Mozart, Brahms, Beethoven, and Tchaikovsky. During the 1994-95 season, Maazel placed American works in the spotlight by including one American composition in each of 24 concert programs. For the latter the PSO was awarded the ASCAP/John Edwards Award for Commitment to American Music by the American Symphony Orchestra League.",
            "The PSO has embarked on a second century of superb music making with the support of a devoted and international audience. More than half a million people hear the PSO in concert every year, and millions more enjoy the orchestra's splendid performances through radio broadcasts and recordings.",
            "In order to maintain the artistic excellence which distinguishes the Orchestra, a capital campaign was launched in 1993 to increase the PSO's endowment by $70 million. The receipt of an extraordinary lead gift of $20 million from the Howard Heinz and Vira I. Heinz Endowments - the largest single gift ever awarded a symphony orchestra capital campaign - gave the Orchestra confidence it needed to meet its goal and fulfill its mission for many years to come.",
            "On April 10, 1995, the Orchestra announced the appointment of Mariss Jansons to succeed Maazel in 1996. As eighth Music Director of the PSO, he ushered in the next century of extraordinary music making. His performances and recordings with the Oslo Philharmonic, the St. Petersburg (formerly the Leningrad) Philharmonic Orchestra, and the London Philharmonic led the London Times to call him \"one of the most exciting conductors in the world today.\"",
            "In 1995, the PSO also welcomed Marvin Hamlisch as the Orchestra's first Principal Pops Conductor. Composer of over forty motion picture scores and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway showA Chorus Line, Hamlisch previously appeared as guest conductor of symphony orchestras around the world. With three Oscars, four Grammys, a Tony and three Golden Globe awards to his credit, Hamlisch eagerly began exploring new avenues of music-making with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.In January 2004, the PSO with conductor Gilbert Levine became the first American orchestra to perform at the Vatican for Pope John Paul II to commemorate the Pontiff's Silver Jubilee celebration and his lifelong commitment to interfaith understanding and outreach of the Abrahamic faiths.",
            "The appearance at the Vatican was an expression of the highest regard for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra's artistic excellence and standing in the worldwide music community.",
            "Music can make a difference.It has the potential to bring all people together. -Marvin Hamlisch",
            "The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra entered a bold new era with the 2005-06 season introducing its innovative model for artistic leadership. The team of Sir Andr\u00e9w Davis, serving as Artistic Advisor; Yan Pascal Tortelier, Principal Guest Conductor; and Marek Janowski, Endowed Guest Conductor Chair, bring to the orchestra significant expertise in a richly diverse repertoire. Each focuses on different areas of repertoire, which highlights their strengths and interests.",
            "Sir Andr\u00e9w Davis, while providing overall programming input regarding the entire season and leading the orchestra in a variety of styles, pays special attention to the music of British and American composers.",
            "Yan Pascal Tortelier focuses on French composers and hidden treasures of the 20th century along with music of the 21st century.",
            "Marek Janowski has had a relationship with the Orchestra since 1991, conducting the great masters of the German-Austrian repertoire that have been central to the identity of the orchestra since the days of former Music Director William Steinberg.",
            "Purchase recordings from the Sir Andrew Davis, Yan Pascal Tortelier and Marek Janowski team \u2192",
            "In January 2007, after several highly successful guest appearances leading the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra,Manfred Honeckwas appointed its ninth music director, and began this position at the start of the 2008-2009 season. Austrian born, Honeck studied music at the Academy of Music in Vienna. He performed in various capacities with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra \u2014 as violinist, violist and guest conductor. In addition to his directorship of the Pittsburgh Symphony, Honeck has served as music director of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra and Staatsoper Stuttgart and as guest conductor of the Czech Philharmonic.At the time of his appointment, Honeck remarked, \u201cIt is with great joy that I assume the post of music director of one of the world's finest orchestras. I am aware that this wonderful task is accompanied by great responsibility with regard to maintaining and enhancing the high level of performance developed by my predecessors and the orchestra together. It is no exaggeration to say that the orchestra and I got on like a house on fire.\u201dThe sentiment could not be truer, with the orchestra and Maestro Honeck receiving rave reviews for their collaborations, including theirmany recordingstogether, with the first in 2009 on the Exton label, Strauss\u2019Ein Heldenleben. Under Honeck, the Pittsburgh Symphony has had numerous GRAMMY nominations, including three GRAMMY award nominations in a single year. In 2018, the PSO won two GRAMMY awards for the albumShostakovich: Symphony No. 5; Barber: Adagioin the categories Best Orchestral Performance and Best Engineered Album (Classical) with engineer Mark Donahue.",
            "In May 2009, Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony embarked on a tour to Asia. The first international tour with Honeck as music director marked the Orchestra\u2019s debut in Shanghai, China and Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and the Orchestra\u2019s first performance in Beijing since 1987. In fall 2009, Honeck and the orchestra were invited to close the prestigious Lucerne Festival in Lucerne, Switzerland. The Symphony has gone on many tours since then, performing in concert halls across Europe and in Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center within the U.S. Honeck has extended his contract with the Pittsburgh Symphony for a remarkable third time, through the 2027-2028 season.",
            "Honeck continues to create remarkable collaborations between the Pittsburgh Symphony and other conductors and musicians as well. His staged version of Handel\u2019sMessiahset across three periods of American history with stage director Samuel Helfrich in 2011 was a remarkable achievement. Helfrich returned to work with Honeck and the Symphony on a semi-staged presentation of Bach\u2019s St. John Passion in 2016 and Haydn\u2019sCreationin 2017.Superstar cellist Yo-Yo Ma, violinist Itzhak Perlman, pianist Lang Lang, and violinist Joshua Bell have performed as guest soloists at Pittsburgh Symphony gala concerts, and notable debuts during Honeck\u2019s tenure include pianists Daniil Trifonov and Til Fellner, percussionist Martin Grubinger and violinist Augustin Hadelich, among others.",
            "Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony are also deeply committed to the Music for the Spirit program, a series of concerts that evolved from the historic appearance of the Pittsburgh Symphony at the Vatican in 2004. This series of community concerts developed a partnership between the orchestra and local faith communities and celebrates the spiritual and universal message of music.",
            "In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Pittsburgh Symphony to cancel the remainder of its concerts for the 2019-2020 season. Instead, the Symphony offered online concerts throughout the 2020-2021 season. The Pittsburgh Symphony celebrated its 125thanniversary with an online gala in February 2021. In summer of 2021, the Pittsburgh Symphony began to perform to a live audience outdoors, and eventually in the fall, Heinz Hall was reopened to audiences.",
            "In 2020, the Pittsburgh Symphony welcomed its second Principal Pops Conductor,Byron Stripling. A conductor, trumpet virtuoso, singer, and actor, Stripling has been a featured soloist with pops orchestras across the country. He has performed with jazz notables from the Count Basie Orchestra and the bands of Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Brubeck, Lionel Hampton, and more. Stripling\u2019s first concert as Principal Pops conductor was an online performance in October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He continued to have multiple \u201cfirsts\u201d with the symphony, performing his first in-person concert in summer of 2021 at Hartwood Acres, and his first in-person Pops concert of the season at Heinz Hall in fall of the same year.",

            "Heinz Hall, dedicated in 1971 and last renovated in 2015, is the cornerstone of the Cultural District of Pittsburgh. This cultural-entertainment focal point of the Golden Triangle has helped spur the continuing economic and cultural revitalization of downtown Pittsburgh. With its international reputation for grandeur and excellence as a concert hall and showplace, the 2,675\u2011seat Heinz Hall is home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.",
            "The Hall is centrally located near Gateway Center, PPG Place, Dominion Tower, Fifth Avenue Place and Liberty Center, and within walking distance of Heinz Field, PNC Park and the CONSOL Energy Center. The Cultural District offers many restaurants, hotels and parking facilities within easy walking distance to the Hall.",
            "The structure evolved from its origin in 1927 as the Loew\u2019s Penn Theater to its renovation and dedication as Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts in 1971 \u2014 \u201ca gift to the Pittsburgh Symphony Society from the Howard Heinz Endowment . . . to encourage, foster and perpetuate the performing arts in the Greater Pittsburgh area.\u201d Each year more than a half-million patrons attend symphony concerts and other attractions, ranging from Pops concerts to children\u2019s concerts to national Broadway touring shows.",
            "For 45 years prior to the origin of the Loew\u2019s Penn Theater, the building that stood at this location was the Hotel Anderson. From 1880 to 1925, this hotel provided both accommodations and entertainment. Before 1900, the hotel frequently housed traveling acting companies. The guest list ranged from visiting businessmen to Shakespearean actors. Prior to 1880, the name of the hotel was the St. Clair. Most probably, Edwin Booth (1833-1893), brother of John Wilkes Booth, and his acting company stayed at the St. Clair, or later at the Anderson Hotel, during their many tours across the United States. After 1900, the Anderson developed a somewhat seedy reputation, lost much of its appeal and met its demise.",
            "Built on the same location as the Anderson, the Loew\u2019s Penn Theater was constructed in 1927. Motion picture magnate Marcus Loew hired the architectural firm of Rapp & Rapp to design the opulent movie house. Known as Pittsburgh\u2019s \u201cTemple of the Cinema,\u201d the building was regarded as the most magnificent theater between New York and Chicago. Audible gasps from first-nighters would be heard as they entered the Grand Lobby on opening night of the rococo showplace. A marble staircase led from the Grand Lobby with its 50-foot-high vaulted Venetian ceiling supported by massive ornamental columns.",
            "Bronze and crystal chandeliers and imported silk damask draperies and hangings complimented the lobby artwork. An organ, which would be destroyed in a 1936 flood, was touted to be \u201cthe greatest musical instrument the world has ever known.\u201d Those in attendance were treated to a two-hour silent film and live stage show.",
            "Such spectacles were not restricted to Pittsburgh. In the early decades of the century, Americans flocked in droves to similarly designed theaters. These flamboyant and stately palaces were built of the most costly materials, embellished with gold leaf cherubs, crystal chandeliers, Carrara marble and Persian tiles.",
            "With the advent of television, declining attendance and the rising costs of maintaining such landmarks, the Penn Theater, in line with the nation\u2019s other great movie palaces, was forced to shut its doors in 1964. The building then sat vacant for five years. Destined to be demolished to make way for a parking lot, the building was nearly destroyed until the Pittsburgh Symphony intervened. The Orchestra was searching for a new home, having outgrown Carnegie Music Hall and the Syria Mosque, and the economic advantages to recycling the well-constructed theater were clearly apparent. To explore the feasibility of using the building, Henry J. Heinz II and Charles Denby, president of the Pittsburgh Symphony Society, toured the old movie palace. Together they had the vision to look past the rundown interior and see that with proper restoration the hall could be a brilliant cultural center. Along with Adolph W. Schmidt, president of the A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and Theodore L. Hazlett, Jr., representing the Allegheny Conference and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, these men worked with the architectural firm of Stotz, Hess, MacLachlan & Fosner to begin the construction.",
            "The $10\u2011million reconstruction took place over a three-year period, with much of the work completed by local craftsmen and artisans. Much of the basic architecture of the building remained unchanged from the original French Court style. The entrance to the theater was moved into the area that had once been a coffee shop. The 40\u2011foot Alcoa window replaced the original entrance and rises above the Grand Lobby.",
            "Breche opal and Lavanto marble, plush red velvet and shimmering crystal are the main elements in the decoration of the interior of the Hall. The gold detailing throughout is 24-karat gold leaf, which was applied by two local craftsmen of the A. J. Vater Company, who worked on its application for 18 months. The two spectacular 15\u2011foot chandeliers in the Grand Lobby, weighing more than one ton each and which were part of the original theater, were dismantled, redesigned and recrystalled. The crystals on these and all of the chandeliers were imported from J. & L. Lobmyer of Vienna. The acoustical consultant was Dr. Heinrich Keilholz of Salzburg, Austria. An adjustable orchestra pit, to accommodate 85 musicians and powered by a hydraulic lift, was added for opera and stage performances.",
            "As part of the renovation, a new, five-story wing was added to the rear of the building, which added 28 feet to the stage, plus dressing rooms, music library and rehearsal room facilities. The main rehearsal room was designed to the exact dimensions of the stage area, and all of the rooms are soundproofed and equipped with acoustical panels.",
            "September 10, 1971 was the Grand Opening of Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts. It was a celebration of ceremony and pageantry, with flowers, dinners, champagne and music. Many of Pittsburgh's most prominent citizens were in attendance for the festivities and a Pittsburgh Symphony concert under the baton of William Steinberg. The guest list included such dignitaries as Marian Anderson, Samuel Barber, Charlton Heston, James Earl Jones, Agnes de Mille, Gregory Peck, Cyril Ritchard, Rudolf Serkin and Nancy Hanks, then chair of the National Council on the Arts.",
            "In February 1978, Henry J. Heinz II, chairman of the Howard Heinz Endowment, announced the Endowment\u2019s plans to finance the construction of the Heinz Hall Plaza, a garden adjacent to Heinz Hall, as well as a four\u2011story addition to the Hall. The same Pittsburgh architectural firm that designed the renovation initiated the Plaza project and the addition to the Hall, and its successor firm of MacLachlan, Cornelius & Filoni completed the design.",
            "The Garden Plaza opened on May 7, 1982. The waterfall was designed by the architects, and the moving water sculpture,Quartet, is a design by Angela Connor of London. This addition to the hall consists of three main areas: The Richard S. Rauh Garden Room, a first\u2011floor bar and lounge that connects the Hall and the plaza; the Overlook Room, a second bar/lounge overlooking the plaza; and the Mozart Room, an elegant dining and meeting room. The two Regency Rooms, public areas in the lower level of the Hall, were refurbished in 1988, and are used as dining and reception facilities. In 2001, the Regency Rooms were renamed the \u201cDorothy Porter Simmons Regency Rooms.\u201d",
            "The 1986\u20111987 season was the occasion for a triple anniversary in Heinz Hall. It was the observance of the 90th anniversary of the Pittsburgh Symphony, the 60th anniversary of the Pittsburgh Symphony Society and the 15th anniversary year for Heinz Hall. The anniversary season culminated in a tribute to the late Henry J. Heinz II. All of the original constituent organizations of Heinz Hall joined with the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony in saluting the man whose vision and leadership resulted in the creation of Pittsburgh\u2019s Cultural District. The occasion also marked the Heinz Hall farewell appearances of those constituents: the Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh Ballet, Civic Light Opera and the Pittsburgh Dance Council. Their new home, beginning with the1987\u20111988 season, became the Benedum Center. The Benedum Center, restored from another grand movie house, the Stanley Theater, is one block from Heinz Hall and became the second performing arts center to open in the downtown Cultural District.",
            "Following the tragic death of Senator John Heinz in April 1991, a tribute to the late senator and celebration of the hall\u2019s 20th anniversary were celebrated in Heinz Hall on October 2 of the same year. Guests from all points of the globe descended on Pittsburgh to participate in the celebration of the life of the late senator and to toast the first two decades of the Hall as the flagship performing arts center in the city. The vision and lives of Henry J. Heinz II, architect of the dream of Pittsburgh\u2019s cultural district, and his son H. John Heinz III were honored. That evening the auditorium of Heinz Hall was named in honor of H. John Heinz III, with his wife, Teresa, and their three sons in attendance for the tribute.",
            "During 1995, Heinz Hall underwent a four-month, $6.5-million renovation. Funding for the project was provided by a $4-million grant by the Howard Heinz Endowment, plus Commonwealth of Pennsylvania funding of $2.5 million under the Strategy 21 program. Architect Albert Filoni, of MacLachlan Cornelius & Filoni, and acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard designed the plans for the acoustical, technical and aesthetic improvements to the Hall. The enhancements included a new orchestra shell, acoustical risers, new butterfly sound reflector, heating and air conditioning improvements, fresh paint, wallpaper and gold leaf, auditorium seats refurbished and realigned, new carpeting, a latecomer\u2019s gallery and audio/visual refinements. The grand reopening of the newly refurbished hall was September 15, opening night of the Pittsburgh Symphony\u2019s 1995-1996 Centennial season. Dignitaries present for the ribbon-cutting ceremony included Governor Tom Ridge and Teresa Heinz, wife of the late Senator John Heinz.",
            "During the most recent decade, Heinz Hall has undergone a number of less visible, but equally important renovations. In 2009, several sidewalks around the hall were replaced with new brick and additional light poles were added. In 2010, a water conservation project replaced plumbing fixtures, aerators, shower heads and a number of critical valves throughout the building to continue the \u201cgreening\u201d of Heinz Hall and better steward important utility resources. The Garden Plaza received a fresh landscaping look the same year and Common Plea Catering began operating the Garden Caf\u00e9, which is open to the public, for lunch service during summer months. In 2011, the Heinz Hall sound system was revamped prior to the 2011-2012 season, resulting in praise from artists, touring productions and patrons alike. The next year, the sound booth was extended in the auditorium, allowing a sound technician to be present while mixing sound at various concerts. Also in 2012, a grant from the Allegheny County Community Infrastructure and Tourism Fund allowed for the completion of a roof project, putting all roofs on the building under warranty until 2026. That same year, two high-efficiency cooking towers replaced the 41-year-old towers and the fluorescent lighting in the hall was converted to LED lighting \u2014 including all 924 light bulbs in the theater chandeliers. In 2013, the hall\u2019s fire and life safety systems were upgraded through funds from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the RK Mellon Foundation. This included new exits signs, alarm horns, strobe lights and automatic messaging along with full coverage smoke detectors, making Heinz Hall the safest theater in the Cultural District! Most recently, in 2015, the backstage freight elevator was renovated with a backdoor and a new stop, allowing those with mobility issues easier access to the back stage area. Prior to the 2015 gala, the Grand Tier Lounge was renovated. The room was divided into two spaces, which gives flexibility to use it as one large room, or two smaller rooms. During Pittsburgh Symphony concerts, the room is divided into the UBS Encore Lounge for members and the\u00a0Grand Tier Lounge, each with its own bar and restroom facilities.",
            "Heinz Hall remains home to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, which performs more than 40 weeks of concerts in the Hall each season. The Pittsburgh Youth Symphony also performs in the Hall.",
            "The expanded Pittsburgh Broadway Series, which is presented by the Pittsburgh Symphony, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and Broadway Across America, continues to bring the best and most exciting national touring attractions to Heinz Hall and the Benedum Center.
