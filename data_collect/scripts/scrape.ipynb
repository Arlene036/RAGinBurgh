The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[40]The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[41]Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties.

In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[87]', \"In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, theAmerican Lung Associationranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[88][89]The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel'sClairton Coke Works, the nation's largestcokemill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[90]The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[91]\", 'Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[92]ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It\\'s the best it\\'s been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ...

Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[94]\", \"Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average.[95]The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.[95]Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh.[95]The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities.[95]This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[96]\", 'Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh.[97]WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education.[97]In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[98]', 'Water quality', 'The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[99]This is caused byfrequently overflowing untreated sewageinto local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has acombined sewersystem, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[100]Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[101]As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[102]Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[103]The local sewage authority,Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from theEPAto come up with solutions.[104]In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2\\xa0billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.[105][106]', \"Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority(PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[107]In 2017,Mayor William Pedutoadvocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[108]Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[107]\", \"PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water.[109]Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels.[110]In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties.[111]By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality.[111]Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014,[110]from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection.[112]Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water.[112]\", 'In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water.[112]Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit.[110]In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia.[111]In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[113]Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water.[113]PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[113]', 'There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system.[114]Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[114]Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.[115]', 'Demographics', '2020 census', \"At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.Non-Hispanic whiteswere 64.8% of the population in 2010,[119]compared to 78.7% in 1970.[120]By the2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[118]Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.\", 'Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American.

An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950.[13]Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now.[142]These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.[13]\", 'In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.[145]', 'Economy', 'Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

Pittsburgh is one of the few U.S. cities or towns to be spelled with anhat the end\\nof aburgsuffix, although the spellingPittsburgwas acceptable for many years and was even held as standard by the federal government (but not the city government) from 1891 to 1911.', 'Etymology', 'Pittsburgh was named in honor ofWilliam Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, often referred to as William Pitt the Elder to distinguish him from his sonWilliam Pitt the Younger.', 'The suffixburghis theScots languageandScottish Englishcognateof theEnglish languageborough, which has other cognates in words and place names in severalIndo-European languages. Historically, thismorphemewas used inplace namesto describe a location as being defensible, such as a hill, a fort, or a fortified settlement.[1][note 1]', 'History and spellings', 'Pittsburgh was so named when British forces capturedFort Duquesneduring theFrench and Indian War(Seven Years War). The earliest known references to the new name of the settlement are in letters sent byGeneral John Forbes, dated 26 and 27 November 1758, reporting the capture of the fort. In copies of and quotes from those letters in later sources, the name of Pittsburgh is spelled with and without theh, and sometimes with anobefore theu.[note 2]As a Scotsman, General Forbes probably pronounced the name/ˈpɪtsbərə/PITS-bər-ə, similar to the pronunciation of \"Edinburgh\" as a Scotsman would say it:/ˈɛdɪnbərə/ⓘED-in-bər-ə.[10][11][12]The name appeared in print at least as early as 14 December 1758, when thePennsylvania Gazettepublished a letter written by a member of Forbes\\'s army from \"Pittsburgh (formerly Fort Duquesne)\".[13]', \"For a long time, there was little regard for uniformity in the spelling of Pittsburgh's name.[14]Early municipal documents and city directories generally spelled the name with a finalh,[15]but the letter is notably omitted in thecity charterenacted by the state legislature in 1816.[14]The variance in spelling persisted through the 19th century. In 1890, some local newspapers were using the finalhand some were not.[14]\", 'The name of the city was normally spelled without anhinGerman(includingPennsylvania Dutch), in which geographical names ending in-burgand-berg(and never followed by anh) are very common.', 'Federal board decisions', 'In 1890, theUnited States Board on Geographic Nameswas created to establish uniform place name usage throughout the various departments and agencies of the U.S. government. To guide its standardization efforts, the Board adopted thirteen general principles, one of which was that the final-hshould be dropped from place names ending in-burgh.[16]The Board compiled a report of place name \"decisions\" in 1891 in which Pittsburgh\\'s name for federal government purposes was renderedPittsburg.[17][note 3]', 'In support of its decision favoring thePittsburgspelling, the Board referenced the 1816 city charter. The full decision and rationale from the Board follows:', 'Pittsburg. Pennsylvania.The city was chartered in 1816, its name being spelled without theh, and its official form is still Pittsburg. Thehappears to have been added by the Post-Office Department, and through that action local usage appears to have become divided. While the majority of local newspapers print it without theh, certain others use the finalh.[18]', \"The Board's decisions were compulsory upon all federal government agencies, including the Post Office. Outside the federal government, the decisions, while highly influential,[17]were not officially binding.[19]The Pittsburgh city government continued to use the spelling with theh,[10]as did such local institutions as the PittsburghGazette, thePittsburgh Stock Exchangeand theUniversity of Pittsburgh.[14]In 1908, aPittsburgh Chamber of Commercecommittee, after conducting a review of historical documents, endorsedPittsburghas the proper way to spell the city's name and looked toward getting that spelling federally recognized.[20]Responding to mounting pressure and, in the end, political pressure from senatorGeorge T. Oliver, the names board reversed itself and added anhto its spelling of the city on July 19, 1911.[14]The letter sent to Senator Oliver to announce this decision, dated July 20, stated:\", 'Hon. George T. Oliver, United States Senate:', 'Sir: At a special meeting of the United States Geographic Board held on July 19, 1911, the previous decision with regard to the spelling of Pittsburgh without a final H was reconsidered and the form given below was adopted:Pittsburgh, a city in Pennsylvania (not Pittsburg).Very respectfully,C. S. SLOAN,', 'Secretary.[21]', \"With the spelling controversy largely settled, theh-less form of the city's name headed toward extinction. There were some holdouts: the city's largest-circulation newspaper,The Pittsburg Press, adhered to the shorter spelling until 1921;[22]The Pittsburg DispatchandThe Pittsburg Leaderdid so until ceasing publication in 1923.[23]\", 'Many cities across the United States named after the city of Pittsburgh, such asPittsburg, Kansas,Pittsburg, California, andWest Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, continue to use thePittsburgspelling in their names. Other independent municipalities, such as the borough ofEast Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reflect the modern spelling.', 'Baseball card', 'Perhaps the most familiar reference to thePittsburgspelling is on the renowned 1909T-206baseball cardofPittsburgh PirateslegendHonus Wagner. Its scarcity, even at the time, combined with Wagner\\'s reputation as one of the greatest players in baseball history, made it the most valuable sports card of all time, with one pristine specimen yielding $6.61\\xa0million (equivalent to $7.43\\xa0million in 2023)[24]at auction.[25]It has been characterized as the \"Holy Grail\" of baseball cards.[26]The city name displayed across Wagner\\'s jersey on the card was an artistic addition that did not actually appear on the Pirates\\' uniforms of the time.[27][28]The portrait of Wagner makes it appear as if there could be anHon the end, cut off by the border of the picture, but this notion is countered by the appearance of \"PITTSBURG\" in the underlying caption and on other Pirate portraits from the T-206 card set.', 'The-hin Pittsburgh culture', 'The presence of the-hat the end of the wordPittsburghis occasionally recognized in Pittsburgh culture.  It is often rendered asPGH. For example,Pittsburgh International Airport\\'s abbreviation is PIT, whileUnion Station\\'s abbreviation is PGH.

This required the construction of a military trail known as theForbes Road, which became an important route for settlement of theWestern United States.', 'Forbes died inPhiladelphiaand was buried in the chancel ofChrist Church.', 'Life', 'John Forbes was born inDunfermlineon 5 September 1707, youngest child of Colonel John Forbes, 1658–1707, who died several months before his birth, and Elizabeth Graham, daughter of an Edinburgh merchant. His uncle,Duncan Forbes(1644-1704), was a prominent supporter ofWilliam of Orangeand obtained his brother John an army commission.[1]', 'In 1701, Colonel Forbes purchasedPittencrieff Park, nearDunfermline, and it was here John grew up. He had five elder sisters, of whom little is known, and two older brothers; Arthur (1703-1757), who inherited the estate, and Hugh (1704-1760), who became a lawyer.[2]All three of the Forbes brothers had problems with money; John borrowed large sums to pursue his military career, while Arthur ruined himself expanding Pittencrief, which was sold after his death.[3]', 'Forbes married Anna Donald and had a daughter Anna.', 'Career', \"The Forbes family were prominent civic leaders inInverness, who supported the succession ofGeorge Iin 1714 and were political allies of theCampbell Dukes of Argyll. John's cousinDuncan Forbes of Culloden, (1685-1747), becamesenior Scottish legal officerin 1737 and played a key role in suppressing the1745 Jacobite Rising. These personal connections were essential; like many contemporaries, John was also aFreemason, another of the informal networks needed for a successful public career in this period.[4]\", 'Educated locally inDunfermline, Forbes is thought to have studied medicine atEdinburgh University.[5]In September 1729, he was appointed surgeon in theRoyal Scots Greys,[a]then based in Scotland. He remained with the regiment for the next 28 years but gave up his medical post in 1735, when he was commissioned as acornet.[6]', 'The long period of peace from 1713 to 1739 meant limited opportunities for promotion, while thecommission purchase systemworked against those like Forbes with little money.[b]It was not until April 1742 he was promotedlieutenant, shortly before the regiment was posted to theAustrian Netherlandsto fight in theWar of the Austrian Succession.[7]Forbes becameaide-de-camptoJames Campbell of Lawers, (1690-1745), colonel of the Scots Greys and commander of the Allied cavalry. He fought atDettingenin June 1743 and in September 1744, purchased a commission as captain.[8]', \"AtFontenoyin May 1745, Campbell sent Forbes with instructions toBrigadier General Ingoldsbyon the Allied right, ordering him to attack a Frenchredoubtwhose fire was impeding their advance. One shot badly wounded Sir James, who was carried from the field; Forbes stayed with him after the Allies retreated and was taken prisoner. He was soon exchanged but Campbell died a few days later and Forbes' letters display genuine grief at his death.[9]\", \"Many viewed Fontenoy as a 'defeat snatched from the jaws of victory', and in the recriminations that followed, Ingoldsby wascourt-martialled. The grounds were his failure to comply with three separate orders to attack the French position, given by Campbell,Cumberland, the Allied commander, andLigonier. Ingoldsby claimed he received conflicting instructions and attempted to blame Forbes, who testified at his trial. While he had some justification, any confusion was caused by Cumberland, not Forbes; in any case, this was not considered an adequate excuse and Ingoldsby was forced to resign.[10]\", \"For reasons that are unclear, unlike many who fought at Fontenoy Forbes did not benefit from Cumberland's patronage, although he was appointed aide to the elderlyEarl of Stair, (1673-1747), Campbell's successor as colonel of the Scots Greys. Some units were sent to Britain in October to put down the 1745 Rising, but not the cavalry, since transporting horses by sea was considered impractical during the winter months. Stair was military commander of Southern Britain and Forbes may have served there for a short period but contrary to legend, he was not present atCulloden.[11]Instead, he returned to Flanders in December 1745 asDeputy Quartermaster-Generaland was a major whenthe war endedin 1748.[12]\", 'Forbes spent the next few years on garrison duty in different parts of Britain and in November 1750, purchased a commission as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Scots Greys.[13]To do so, he borrowed £5,000 but with limited opportunities for further advancement, his debts became an increasingly large problem.[14]', 'The Forbes Expedition', 'TheTreaty of Aix-la-Chapelleset up a commission to resolve territorial disputes between British and French colonies in North America, including theOhio Country,French AcadiaandNova Scotia. Neither side was willing to make concessions, which led to the 1754-1763French and Indian War; in 1755, anexpedition under General Braddockto captureFort Duquesneended in a disastrous defeat.[15]', \"When the global conflict known as theSeven Years' Warbegan in 1756, James Campbell's nephew, theEarl of Loudoun, was appointedCommander-in-Chief, North Americaand Governor General ofVirginia. In early 1757, Forbes was in Southern England, training a 'light company' of the Scots Greys for attacks on the French coast.[16]In March, he was promoted colonel of the17th Foot, part of a force of 5,400 sent to Novia Scotia for an attempt on Louisbourg.[17]\", \"Following the failure of the1757 Louisbourg Expedition, Forbes was promotedBrigadier generalin December 1757 andgiven command of another attackon Fort Duquesne. His force contained 1,400 regulars, 400 from theRoyal American Regiment, commanded by the experienced Swiss mercenary, Lt-ColonelHenry Bouquet, along with 1,000 Scots who made upMontgomerie's Highlanders. There were also 5,000 provincial militia from Virginia and Pennsylvania, commanded byGeorge Washington, who had carried messages to Fort Le Boeuf in 1753, and accompanied Braddock in 1755.[18]\", \"Forbes decided to build a new road from thePennsylvaniafrontier, since it required fewer river crossings than that used by Braddock, which followed a trail cut in 1752 by the Virginia-basedOhio Company. The decision led to protests from his Virginian officers, many of whom were investors in the company, including two of Washington's brothers.[19]\", \"As a compromise, Forbes agreed to improve Braddock's original road, but use the route through Pennsylvania. A base was established atCarlisle, Pennsylvania, and a trail cut through theAllegheny Mountains, which became theForbes Road. Already severely ill, Forbes had to be carried in a litter and relied heavily on Bouquet, who commanded the advance guard. Construction of the road and bases such asFort Ligonierwas supervised by Lt-Colonel John St Clair, who proved to be incompetent and required Forbes to do much of the work, despite his poor health.[20]\", \"A less appreciated aspect of Forbes' leadership was in building relationships with local Native Americans, who previously refused to co-operate with the British. These efforts were bolstered by the capture ofFort Frontenacin August, increasing British prestige, while the loss of French traders severely impacted the local economy.[21]This methodical approach was jeopardised by theBattle of Fort Duquesne, on 15 September 1758, when a column under Major James Grant advanced too far ahead of the main body and suffered over 300 casualties. Forbes decided to suspend operations but on 26 October, 13 Ohio Valley tribes signed theTreaty of Eastonwith Pennsylvania andNew Jersey.[22]\", \"After the loss of their local allies, the French abandoned Fort Duquesne and the British took possession on 25 November. Forbes ordered the construction ofFort Pitt, named after British Secretary of StatePitt the Elder. He also established a settlement between the rivers, the site of modernPittsburgh.[23]His health rapidly declined during the campaign; described as a 'wasting disease', this is thought to have been stomach cancer, combined with severedysentery.\", \"On 3 December 1758, he left ColonelHugh Mercerin command and returned toPhiladelphia, where he died on 11 March 1759 and was buried with full military honours.

Historians call him \"Chatham\" or \"Pitt the Elder\" to distinguish him from his sonWilliam Pitt the Younger, who also served as prime minister. Pitt was also known as \"the Great Commoner\" because of his long-standing refusal to accept a title until 1766.', \"Pitt was a member of the British cabinet and with a brief interlude in 1757, its informal leader from 1756 to 1761, during theSeven Years' War(including theFrench and Indian Warin theAmerican colonies). He again led the ministry, holding the official title ofLord Privy Seal, between 1766 and 1768. Much of his power came from his brilliant oratory.[1]He was out of power for most of his career and became well-known for his attacks on the government, such as those onWalpole's corruption in the 1730s, Hanoverian subsidies in the 1740s,peace with France in the 1760s, and the policy toward the American colonies during the 1770s.[2]\", \"Pitt is best known as the wartime political leader of Britain during the Seven Years' War, especially for his single-minded devotion to victory over France, a victory that ultimately solidified Britain's dominance over world affairs. He is also known for his popular appeal, his opposition to corruption in government, his support for the American position in the run-up to theAmerican Revolutionary War, his advocacy of British greatness,expansionism, and empire, and his antagonism toward Britain's chief enemies and rivals for colonial power,SpainandFrance.[3]Marie Peters argues his statesmanship was based on a clear, consistent, and distinct appreciation of the value of the Empire.[4]\", \"The British parliamentary historianP. D. G. Thomasargued that Pitt's power was based not on his family connections, but on the extraordinary parliamentary skills by which he dominated theHouse of Commons. He displayed a commanding manner, brilliant rhetoric, and sharp debating skills that cleverly used his broad literary and historical knowledge.[5]Scholars rank him highly among all British prime ministers.[6]\", 'Early life', 'Family', 'Pitt was the grandson ofThomas Pitt(1653–1726), the governor ofMadras, known as \"Diamond\" Pitt for having discovereda diamondof extraordinary size and having sold it to theDuke of Orléansfor approximately £135,000.[7]This transaction, as well as other trading deals inIndia, established the Pitt family fortune. After returning home the governor was able to raise his family to a position of wealth and political influence: in 1691 he purchased the property ofBoconnocinCornwall, which gave him control of aseat in Parliament. He made further land purchases and became one of the dominant political figures in theWest Country, controlling seats such as therotten boroughofOld Sarum.[8]', \"William's mother wasHarriet Villiers,[9]the daughter ofEdward Villiers-FitzGeraldand theIrishheiressKatherine FitzGerald.[10]William's father wasRobert Pitt(1680–1727), the eldest son of Governor Pitt. He served as aToryMember of Parliamentfrom 1705 to 1727.\", \"Both William's unclesThomasandJohnwere MPs, while his auntLucymarried the leadingWhigpolitician and soldier GeneralJames Stanhope. From 1717 to 1721, Stanhope served as effective First Minister in theStanhope–Sunderland Ministry,[11]and was a useful political contact for the Pitt family until the collapse of theSouth Sea Bubble, a disaster that engulfed the government.\", 'Birth and education', 'William Pitt was born atGolden Square,Westminster, on 15 November 1708.[12]His older brotherThomas Pitthad been born in 1704 and they had five sisters: Harriet, Catherine, Ann, Elizabeth, and Mary. From 1719, William was educated atEton Collegealong with his brother. William disliked Eton, later claiming that \"apublic schoolmight suit a boy of turbulent disposition but would not do where there was any gentleness\".[13]It was at school that Pitt began to suffer fromgout. Governor Pitt died in 1726, and the family estate at Boconnoc passed to William\\'s father. When he died the following year, Boconnoc was inherited by William\\'s elder brother,Thomas Pitt of Boconnoc.', \"In January 1727, William was entered as agentleman commoneratTrinity College, Oxford. There is evidence that he was an extensive reader, if not a minutely accurateclassicalscholar.Virgilwas his favourite author. William diligently cultivated the faculty of expression by the practice of translation and re-translation.[8]In these years he became a close friend ofGeorge Lyttelton,[14]who would later become a leading politician. In 1728, a violent attack of gout compelled him to leave Oxford without finishing his degree. He then chose to travel abroad, from 1728 attendingUtrecht Universityin theDutch Republic,[15]gaining a knowledge ofHugo Grotiusand other writers on international law and diplomacy. It is not known how long Pitt studied at Utrecht;[16]but by 1730 he had returned to his brother's estate at Boconnoc.[17]\", 'He had recovered from the violent attack of gout, but the disease proved intractable, and he continued to be subject to attacks of growing intensity at frequent intervals until his death.[18]', 'Military career', 'On Pitt\\'s return home it was necessary for him, as the younger son, to choose a profession and he opted for a career in the army.[19]He obtained acornet\\'s commission in thedragoonswith the King\\'s Own Regiment of Horse (later1st King\\'s Dragoon Guards).[18]George IInever forgot the jibes of \"the terrible cornet of horse\".[20]It was reported that the£1,000 cost of the commissionhad been supplied byRobert Walpole, the prime minister, out ofTreasuryfunds in an attempt to secure the support of Pitt\\'s brother Thomas in Parliament. Alternatively, the fee may have been waived by the commanding officer of the regiment,Lord Cobham, who was related to the Pitt brothers by marriage.[21]', \"Pitt grew close to Cobham, whom he regarded as almost a surrogate father. He was stationed for much of his service inNorthampton, on peacetime duties. Pitt was particularly frustrated that he had not been tested in battle since Britain had not entered theWar of the Polish Successionthat began in 1733 owing to Walpole's isolationist policies.[22]Pitt was granted extended leave in 1733 and he toured France and Switzerland. He briefly visited Paris, but spent most of his time in the French provinces,[23]spending the winter inLunévillein theDuchy of Lorraine.[24]\", \"Pitt's military career was destined to be relatively short. His elder brother Thomas was returned at thegeneral election of 1734for two separate seats,OkehamptonandOld Sarum, and chose to sit for Okehampton, passing the vacant seat to William who, accordingly, in February 1735, enteredparliamentas member for Old Sarum.[18]He became one of a large number of serving army officers in the House of Commons.\", 'Rise to prominence', 'Patriot Whigs', \"Pitt soon joined a faction of discontentedWhigsknown as thePatriotswho formed part of the opposition. The group commonly met atStowe House, the country estate ofLord Cobham, who was a leader of the group.[25]Cobham had originally been a supporter ofthe governmentunder Sir Robert Walpole, but a dispute over the controversialExcise Billof 1733 had seen them join the opposition. Pitt swiftly became one of the faction's most prominent members.\", \"Pitt'smaiden speechin the Commons was delivered in April 1736, in the debate on the congratulatory address toGeorge IIon the marriage of his sonFrederick, Prince of Wales. He used the occasion to pay compliments, and there was nothing striking in the speech as reported, but it helped to gain him the attention of the House when he later took part on debates on more partisan subjects.[18]In particular, he attacked Britain's non-intervention in theongoing European war, which he believed was in violation of theTreaty of Viennaand the terms of theAnglo-Austrian Alliance.\", \"He became such a troublesome critic of the government that Walpole moved to punish him by arranging his dismissal from the army in 1736, along with several of his friends and political allies. This provoked a wave of hostility to Walpole because many saw such an act asunconstitutional—that members of Parliament were being dismissed for theirfreedom of speechin attacking the government, something protected byParliamentary privilege. None of the men had their commissions reinstated, however, and the incident brought an end to Pitt's military career.[26]The loss of Pitt's commission was soon compensated. The heir to the throne,Frederick, Prince of Wales, was involved in a long-running dispute with his father, George II, and was the patron of theopposition.[27]He appointed Pitt one of hisGrooms of the Bedchamberas a reward.[28]In this new position Pitt's hostility to the government did not in any degree relax, and his oratorical gifts were substantial.[18]\", 'War', 'Spanish war', \"During the 1730s Britain's relationship with Spain had slowly declined. Repeated cases of reported Spanish mistreatment of British merchants, whom they accused of smuggling, caused public outrage, particularly the incident ofJenkins' Ear.[29]Pitt was a leading advocate of a more hard-line policy against Spain and he often castigated Walpole's government for its weakness in dealing withMadrid. Pitt spoke out against theConvention of El Pardothat aimed to settle the dispute peacefully.[30]In the speech against the convention in the House of Commons on 8 March 1739 Pitt said:\", 'When trade is at stake, it is your last entrenchment; you must defend it, or perish\\xa0 ... Sir, Spain knows the consequence of a war in America; whoever gains, it must prove fatal to her\\xa0 ... is this any longer a nation? Is this any longer an English Parliament, if with more ships in your harbours than in all the navies of Europe; with above two millions of people in your American colonies, you will bear to hear of the expediency of receiving from Spain an insecure, unsatisfactory, dishonourable Convention?[31]', \"Owing to public pressure, the British government was pushed toward declaring war with Spain in 1739. Britain began with asuccess at Porto Bello.[32]However the war effort soon stalled, and Pitt alleged that the government was not prosecuting the war effectively—demonstrated by the fact that the British waited two years before taking further offensive action fearing that further British victories would provoke the French into declaring war.[33]When they did so,a failed attackwas made on the South American port ofCartagenathat left thousands of British troops dead, more than half from disease, and cost many ships. The decision to attack during therainy seasonwas held as further evidence of the government's incompetence.\", 'After this, the colonial war against Spain was almost entirely abandoned as British resources were switched toward fighting France in Europe as theWar of the Austrian Successionhad broken out. The Spanish had repelled a major invasion intended to conquer Central America and succeeded in maintaining their trans-Atlantic convoys while causing much disruption to British shipping and twice broke a British blockade to land troops in Italy, but the war with Spain was treated as a draw. Many of the underlying issues remained unresolved by the later peace treaties leaving the potential for future conflicts to occur. Pitt considered the war a missed opportunity to take advantage of a power in decline, although later he became an advocate of warmer relations with the Spanish in an effort to prevent them forming an alliance with France.', 'Hanover', 'Walpole and Newcastle were now giving the war in Europe a much higher priority than the colonial conflict with Spain in the Americas.PrussiaandAustriawent to war in 1740, with many other European states soon joining in.[34]There was a fear that France would launch an invasion ofHanover, which was linked to Britain through the crown ofGeorge II. To avert this, Walpole and Newcastle decided to pay a largesubsidyto both Austria and Hanover, in order for them to raise troops and defend themselves.', \"Pitt then launched an attack on such subsidies, playing to widespread anti-Hanoverian feelings in Britain. This boosted his popularity with the public, but earned him the lifelong hatred of the King, who was emotionally committed to Hanover, where he had spent the first thirty years of his life. In response to Pitt's attacks, the British government decided not to pay a direct subsidy to Hanover, but instead to pass the money indirectly through Austria—a move that was considered more politically acceptable. A sizeableAnglo-German armywas formed that George II led to victory at theBattle of Dettingenin 1743, reducing the immediate threat to Hanover.[35]\", 'Fall of Walpole', \"Many of Pitt's attacks on the government were directed personally at Walpole, who had now been prime minister for twenty years. He spoke in favour of the motion in 1742 for aninquiryinto the last ten years of Walpole's administration. In February 1742, followingpoor election resultsand the disaster at Cartagena, Walpole finally was forced to succumb to the long-continued attacks of opposition, he resigned and took apeerage.[18]\", \"Pitt now expected a new government to be formed led byPulteneyand dominated byToriesandPatriot Whigsin which he could expect a junior position.[36]instead, Walpole was succeeded asprime ministerbyLord Wilmington, although the real power in the new government was divided amongLord Carteretand the Pelham brothers (HenryandThomas, Duke of Newcastle).[18]Walpole had carefully orchestrated this new government as a continuance of his own, and continued to advise it up to his death in 1745. Pitt's hopes for a place in the government were thwarted and he remained in opposition. He was therefore unable to make any personal gain from the downfall of Walpole, to which he had personally contributed a great deal.\", 'After the dismissal of Carteret, theadministration formed by the Pelhamsin 1744 included many of Pitt\\'s former Patriot allies, but Pitt was not granted a position because of continued ill-feeling by the king and leading Whigs about his views on Hanover. In 1744, Pitt received a large boost to his personal fortune when theDowager Duchess of Marlboroughdied leaving him alegacyof £10,000 as an \"acknowledgment of the noble defence he had made for the support of the laws of England and to prevent the ruin of his country\".[37]The inheritance was probably as much a mark of her dislike of Walpole as of her admiration of Pitt.[18]', 'In government', 'Paymaster of the Forces', 'Reluctantly the king finally agreed to give Pitt a place in the government. Pitt had changed his stance on a number of issues to become more acceptable to George, most notably the heated issue of Hanoverian subsidies. To force the matter, the Pelham brothers had to resign on the question of whether he should be admitted or not, and it was only after all other arrangements had proved impracticable, that they were reinstated with Pitt appointed asVice-Treasurer of Irelandin February 1746.[18]George continued to resent him however.', \"In May of the same year Pitt was promoted to the more important and lucrative office ofpaymaster-general, which gave him a place in thePrivy Council, although not in thecabinet. There he had an opportunity of displaying his public spirit and integrity in a way that deeply impressed both the king and the country. It had been the usual practise of previous paymasters to appropriate to themselves the interest of all money lying in their hands by way of advance, and also to accept a commission of1⁄2% on all foreign subsidies. Although there was no strong public sentiment against the practice, Pitt completely refused to profit by it. All advances were lodged by him in theBank of Englanduntil required, and all subsidies were paid over without deduction, even though it was pressed upon him, so that he did not draw ashillingfrom his office beyond thesalarylegally attaching to it.[18]Pitt ostentatiously made this clear to everyone, although he was in fact following whatHenry Pelhamhad done when he had held the post between 1730 and 1743. This helped to establish Pitt's reputation with the British people for honesty and placing the interests of the nation before his own.\", 'Theadministration formed in 1746lasted without major changes until 1754. It would appear from his published correspondence that Pitt had a greater influence in shaping its policy than his comparatively subordinate position would in itself have entitled him to. His support for measures, such as the Spanish Treaty and the continental subsidies, which he had violently denounced when in opposition was criticised by his enemies as an example of his politicalopportunism.[18]', 'Between 1746 and 1748, Pitt worked closely with Newcastle in formulating British military and diplomatic strategy. He shared with Newcastle a belief that Britain should continue to fight until it could receive generous peace terms, in contrast to some such asHenry Pelhamwho favoured an immediate peace. Pitt was saddened when his friend and brother-in-lawThomas Grenvillewas killed at the navalFirst Battle of Cape Finisterrein 1747,[38]however, this victory helped secure British supremacy of the sea that gave the British a stronger negotiating position when it came to the peace talks that ended the war. At theTreaty of Aix-la-Chapellein 1748 British colonial conquests were exchanged for a French withdrawal fromBrussels. Many saw this as merely anarmisticeand awaited an imminent new war.', 'Dispute with Newcastle', 'In 1754, Henry Pelham died suddenly and was succeeded as prime minister by his brother, the Duke of Newcastle. As Newcastle sat in theHouse of Lords, he required a leading politician to represent the government in the House of Commons. Pitt andHenry Foxwere considered the two favourites for the position, but Newcastle instead rejected them both and turned to the less well-known figure of SirThomas Robinson, a careerdiplomat, to fill the post. It was widely believed that Newcastle had done this because he feared the ambitions of both Pitt and Fox, and believed he would find it easier to dominate the inexperienced Robinson.[39]', \"Despite his disappointment there was no immediate open breach. Pitt continued at his post; and at the general election that took place during the year, he even accepted a nomination for the Duke'spocket boroughofAldborough. He had sat forSeafordsince 1747.[40]The government won alandslide, further strengthening its majority in parliament.[41]\", \"When parliament met, however, he made no secret of his feelings. Ignoring Robinson, Pitt made frequent and vehement attacks on Newcastle, although still continuing to serve as Paymaster under him.[40]From 1754, Britain was increasingly drawn into conflict with France during this period, despite Newcastle's wish to maintain the peace. The countries clashed in North America, where each had laid claim to theOhio Country. A British expedition under General Braddockhad been despatched and defeatedin summer 1755 that caused a ratcheting up of tensions.[42]\", 'Eager to prevent the war spreading to Europe, Newcastle now tried to conclude a series of treaties that would secure Britain allies through the payment of subsidies, which he hoped would discourage France from attacking Britain. Similar subsidies had been an issue of past disagreement, and they were widely attacked by Patriot Whigs and Tories. As the government came under increasing attack, Newcastle replaced Robinson with Fox who it was acknowledged carried more political weight and again slighted Pitt.', 'Finally in November 1755, Pitt was dismissed from office as paymaster, having spoken during a debate at great length against the new system of continental subsidies proposed by the government of which he was still a member.[43]Fox retained his own place, and although the two men continued to be of the same party, and afterward served again in the same government, there was henceforward a rivalry between them, which makes the celebrated opposition of their sons,William Pitt the YoungerandCharles James Fox, seem like an inherited quarrel.[40]', \"Pitt's relationship with the Duke slumped further in early 1756 when he alleged that Newcastle was deliberately leaving the island ofMenorcaill-defended so that the French would seize it, and Newcastle could use its loss to prove that Britain was not able to fight a war against France and sue for peace. When in June 1756Menorca fellaftera failed attemptbyAdmiral Byngto relieve it, Pitt's allegations fuelled the public anger against Newcastle, leading him to be attacked by a mob inGreenwich.[44]The loss of Menorca shattered public faith in Newcastle, and forced him to step down as prime minister in November 1756.\", 'Secretary of State', 'In December 1756, Pitt, who now sat forOkehampton, becameSecretary of State for the Southern Department, andLeader of the House of Commonsunder the premiership of theDuke of Devonshire.[40]Upon entering this coalition, Pitt said to Devonshire: \"My Lord, I am sure I can save this country, and no one else can\".[45]', 'He had made it a condition of his joining any administration that Newcastle should be excluded from it, which proved fatal to the lengthened existence of his government. With the king unfriendly, and Newcastle, whose influence was still dominant in the Commons, estranged, it was impossible to carry on a government by the aid of public opinion alone, however emphatically that might have declared itself on his side.[40]The historianBasil Williamshas claimed that this is the first time in British history when a \"man was called to supreme power by the voice of the people\" rather than by the king\\'s appointment or, as the choice of Parliament.[46]', \"Pitt drew up his plans for the campaigning season of 1757 in which he hoped to reverse Britain's string of defeats during the war's opening years.\", 'In April 1757 Pitt was dismissed from office on account of his opposition to the continental policy and the circumstances surrounding the court-martial and execution of AdmiralJohn Byng. He was succeeded by the Duke of Devonshire who formed the1757 Caretaker Ministry. But the power that was insufficient to keep him in office was strong enough to make any arrangement that excluded him, impracticable. The public voice spoke in a way that was not to be mistaken. Probably no English minister ever received in so short a time so many proofs of the confidence and admiration of the public, the capital and all the chief towns voting him addresses and the freedom of their corporations[40](e.g., London presented him with the first everhonoraryFreedomof theCityawarded in history).Horace Walpolerecorded the freedoms of various cities awarded to Pitt:', '... for some weeks it rained gold boxes:Chester,Worcester,Norwich,Bedford,Salisbury,Yarmouth,Tewkesbury,Newcastle-on-Tyne,Stirling, and other populous and chief towns following the example.Exeter, with singular affection, sent boxes of oak.[47]', 'After some weeks\\' negotiation, in the course of which the firmness and moderation of \"The Great Commoner\", as he had come to be called, contrasted favourably with the characteristic tortuosities of the craftypeer, matters were settled on such a basis that, while Newcastle was the nominal, Pitt was the virtual head of the government. On his acceptance of office, he was chosen member forBath.[40]', 'Pitt–Newcastle ministry', \"Seven Years' War\", \"Acoalition with Newcastlewas formed in June 1757, and held power until October 1761. It brought together several various factions and was built around the partnership between Pitt and Newcastle, which a few months earlier had seemed impossible. The two men usedLord Chesterfieldas an intermediary and had managed to agree a division of powers that was acceptable to both.[48]For the past few months Britain had been virtually leaderless, although Devonshire had remained formally prime minister, but now Pitt and Newcastle were ready to offer stronger direction to the country's strategy.\", \"By summer 1757 the British war effort over the previous three years had broadly been a failure. Britain's attempts to take the offensive in North America had ended in disaster, Menorca had been lost, and theDuke of Cumberland'sArmy of Observationwas retreating acrossHanoverfollowing theBattle of Hastenback. In October Cumberland was forced to conclude theConvention of Klosterzeven, which would take Hanover out of the war.[49]TheFrench Invasion of Hanoverposed a threat to Britain's ally Prussia, which was now vulnerable to attack from the west by the French as well as facing attack from Austria,Russia,Saxonyand Sweden.\", \"Although it was late in the campaigning season when he had come to power, Pitt set about trying to initiate a more assertive strategy. He conspired with a number of figures to persuade the Hanoverians to revoke the Klosterzevern Convention and re-enter the war on Britain's side, which they did in late 1757. He also put into practice a scheme ofNaval Descentsthat would makeamphibiouslandings on the French coast. The first of these, theRaid on Rochefort, took place in September but was not a success.[50]The centrepiece of the campaign in North America, anexpedition to capture Louisbourg, was aborted due to the presence of a large French fleet and a gale that scattered the British fleet.\", '1758', \"In 1758 Pitt began to put into practice a new strategy to win the Seven Years' War, which would involve tying down large numbers of French troops and resources in Germany, while Britain used its naval supremacy to launch expeditions to capture French forces around the globe. Following the capture of Emden he ordered the dispatch of the first British troops to the European continent under theDuke of Marlborough, who joinedBrunswick's army.[51]This was a dramatic reversal of his previous position, as he had recently been strongly opposed to any such commitment.\", 'Pitt had been lobbied by an American merchantThomas Cummingto launch an expedition against the French trading settlements inWest Africa. In April 1758British forces capturedthe ill-defended fort ofSaint-LouisinSenegal. The mission was so lucrative that Pitt sent out further expeditions to captureGoréeandGambialater in the year.[52]He also drew up plans to attack French islands in theCaribbeanthe following year at the suggestion of aJamaicansugar planterWilliam Beckford.[53]', \"In North America, asecond British attemptto captureLouisbourgsucceeded. However, Pitt's pleasure over this was tempered by the subsequent news of a significant British defeat at theBattle of Carillon.[54]Toward the end of the year theForbes Expeditionseized the site ofFort Duquesneand began constructing the British-controlled Fort Pitt (which later grew into the city of Pittsburgh). This gave the British control of theOhio Country, which had been the principal cause of the war.\", \"In Europe, Brunswick's forces enjoyed a mixed year. Brunswick had crossed theRhine, but faced with being cut off he had retreated and blocked any potential French move toward Hanover with his victory at theBattle of Krefeld. The year ended with something approaching a stalemate in Germany. Pitt had continued his naval descents during 1758, but the first had enjoyed only limited success and the second ended with near disaster at theBattle of St Castand no further descents were planned.[55]Instead the troops and ships would be used as part of the coming expedition to theFrench West Indies. The scheme of amphibious raids was the only one of Pitt's policies during the war that was broadly a failure, although it did help briefly relieve pressure on the German front by tying down French troops on coastal protection service.\", 'Annus Mirabilis', \"In France a new leader, theDuc de Choiseul, had recently come to power and 1759 offered a duel between their rival strategies. Pitt intended to continue with his plan of tying down French forces in Germany while continuing the assault on France's colonies. Choiseul hoped to repel the attacks in the colonies while seeking total victory in Europe.\", \"Pitt's war around the world was largely successful. While a Britishinvasion of Martiniquefailed, theycaptured Guadeloupeshortly afterward. In India, a Frenchattempt to capture Madraswas repulsed. In North America, British troops closed in on France's Canadian heartland. A British force underJames Wolfemoved up theSaint Lawrencewith the aim of capturingQuebec. After initiallyfailing to penetratethe French defences at theMontmorency Falls, Wolfe later led his mento a victoryto the west of the city allowing the British forces to capture Quebec.[56]\", \"Choiseul had pinned much of his hopes ona French invasion of Britain, which he hoped would knock Britain out of the war and make it surrender the colonies it had taken from France. Pitt had stripped the home islands of troops to send on his expeditions, leaving Britain guarded by poorly trained militia and giving an opportunity for the French if they could land in enough force. The French did build a large invasion force. However the French naval defeats atLagosandQuiberon Bayforced Choiseul to abandon the invasion plans. France's other great hope, that their armies could make a breakthrough in Germany and invade Hanover, was thwarted at theBattle of Minden. Britain ended the year victorious in every theatre of operations in which it was engaged, with Pitt receiving the credit for this.[57]\", '1760–61', 'Britain completed theconquest of Canadain 1760 by capturing Montreal, which effectively brought the war to an end on mainland North America.', \"Pitt's power had now reached its peak, but was soon under threat. The domestic political situation was altered dramatically when George II died in October 1760. He was succeeded by his grandson,George III, who had once considered Pitt an ally but had become angered by Pitt's alliance with Newcastle and acceptance of the need for British intervention in Germany\\xa0– which George was strongly opposed to.[58]The new king successfully lobbied for his favouriteLord Buteto be given the post ofNorthern Secretary. Bute was inclined to support a withdrawal from Germany, and to fight the war with France largely at sea and in the colonies.\", \"Pitt's plan for an expedition to captureBelle Îlewas put into force in April 1761 and it wascaptured after a siege. This provided yet a further blow to French prestige, as it was the first part ofMetropolitan Franceto be occupied.[59]Pitt now expected France to offer terms, although he was prepared for a longer war if necessary. Envoys were exchanged, but neither side could reach an agreement.[60]Pitt's refusal to grant the French a share inNewfoundlandproved the biggest obstacle to peace, as Pitt declared he would rather lose the use of his right arm than give the French a share there and later said he would rather give up theTower of Londonthan Newfoundland. Newfoundland was at the time seen as possessing huge economic and strategic value because of the extensive fishing industry there.[61]\", 'The war in Germany continued through 1761 with the French again attempting to overcome Brunswick and invade Hanover, but suffering a defeat at theBattle of Villinghausen. Pitt had substantially increased the number of British troops serving with Brunswick, and he also planned further conquests in the West Indies. A strategy he hoped would compel the French to conclude a reasonable peace treaty.', 'Treaty of Paris', \"To the preliminaries of thepeaceconcluded in February 1763 he offered an indignant resistance, considering the terms quite inadequate to the successes that had been gained by the country. When the treaty was discussed in parliament in December of the previous year, although suffering from a severe attack of gout, he was carried down to the House, and in a speech of three hours' duration, interrupted more than once by paroxysms of pain, he strongly protested against its various conditions.[62]These conditions included the return of the sugar islands (but Britain retainedDominica); trading stations in West Africa (won by Boscawen);Pondicherry(France's Indian colony); and fishing rights inNewfoundland. Pitt's opposition arose through two heads: France had been given the means to become once more formidable at sea, whilstFrederick of Prussiahad been betrayed.\", 'Pitt believed that the task had been left half-finished and called for a final year of war which would crush French power for good. Pitt had long-held plans for further conquests which had been uncompleted. Newcastle, by contrast, sought peace but only if the war in Germany could be brought to an honourable and satisfactory conclusion (rather than Britain suddenly bailing out of it as Bute proposed). However the combined opposition of Newcastle and Pitt was not enough to prevent the Treaty passing comfortably in both Houses of Parliament.', 'However, there were strong reasons for concluding the peace: the National Debt had increased from £74.5m. in 1755 to £133.25m. in 1763, the year of thepeace. The requirement to pay down this debt, and the lack of French threat in Canada, were major movers in the subsequentAmerican War of Independence.', 'The physical cause which rendered this effort so painful probably accounts for the infrequency of his appearances in parliament, as well as for much that is otherwise inexplicable in his subsequent conduct. In 1763, he spoke against the unpopulartax on cider, imposed by his brother-in-law,George Grenville, and his opposition, although unsuccessful in the House, helped to keep alive his popularity with the country, which cordially hated theexciseand all connected with it. When next year the question ofgeneral warrantswas raised in connexion with the case ofJohn Wilkes, Pitt vigorously maintained their illegality, thus defending at once the privileges of Parliament and thefreedom of the press.[62]', 'During 1765 he seems to have been totallyincapacitatedfor public business. In the following year he supported with great power the proposal of theRockinghamadministration for the repeal of theStamp Act, arguing that it was unconstitutional to impose taxes upon the colonies. He thus endorsed the contention of the colonists on the ground of principle, while the majority of those who acted with him contented themselves with resisting the disastrous taxation scheme on the ground of expediency.[62]', 'The Repeal (1766) of the Stamp Act, indeed, was only passedpari passuwithanothercensuring the Americanassemblies, and declaring the authority of the British parliament over the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\". Thus the House of Commons repudiated in the most formal manner the principle Pitt laid down. His language in approval of the resistance of the colonists was unusually bold, and perhaps no one but himself could have employed it with impunity at a time when the freedom of debate was only imperfectly conceded.[62][63]', \"Pitt had not been long out of office when he was solicited to return to it, and the solicitations were more than once renewed. Unsuccessful overtures were made to him in 1763, and twice in 1765, in May and June—the negotiator in May being the king's uncle, theDuke of Cumberland, who went down in person toHayes, Pitt's seat inKent. It is known that he had the opportunity of joining the Marquess of Rockingham's short-lived administration at any time on his own terms, and his conduct in declining an arrangement with that minister has been more generally condemned than any other step in his public life.[62]\", 'Leadership', 'TheLondon Magazineof 1767 offered \"Pitt, Pompadour, Prussia, Providence\" as the reasons for Britain\\'s success in theSeven Years\\' War.[64]Pitt\\'s relation to all three was such as to entitle him to a large share in the credit of their deeds. He inspired trust in his chosen commanders by his indifference to rules of seniority—several of \"Pitt\\'s boys\", likeKeppel, captor ofGorée, were in their thirties—and by his clear orders.[65]It was his discernment that selected Wolfe to lead the attack onQuebec, and gave him the opportunity of dying a victor on theheights of Abraham. He had personally less to do with the successes in India than with the other great enterprises that shed an undying lustre on his administration; but his generous praise in parliament encouragedRobert Clive, and the forces that acted at the close of the struggle were animated by his indomitable spirit.[40]', \"Pitt's particular genius was to finance an army on the continent to drain French men and resources so that Britain might concentrate on what he held to be the vital spheres: Canada and theWest Indies; whilst Clive successfully defeatedSiraj ud-Daulah, (the last independentNawab of Bengal) atPlassey(1757), securing India. The Continental campaign was carried on byCumberland, defeated atHastenbeckand forced to surrender atConvention of Klosterzeven(1757) and thereafter byFerdinand of Brunswick, later victor atMinden; Britain's Continental campaign had two major strands, firstly subsidising allies, particularly Frederick the Great, and second, financing an army to divert French resources from the colonial war and to also defend Hanover (which was the territory of the Kings of England at this time)\", 'Pitt was a leading imperialist in English history. He was the directing mind in the expansion of his country, and with him the beginning of empire is rightly associated. TheSeven Years\\' Warmight well, moreover, have been anotherThirty Years\\' Warif Pitt had not furnished Frederick with an annual subsidy of £700,000, and in addition relieved him of the task of defending western Germany against France:[40]this was the policy that allowed Pitt to boast of having \"won Canada on the banks of the Rhine\".', \"Contemporary opinion was, of course, incompetent to estimate the permanent results gained for the country by the brilliant foreign policy of Pitt. It has long been generally agreed that by several of his most costly expeditions nothing was really won but glory: the policy of diversionary attacks on places likeRochefortwas memorably described as 'breaking windows with gold guineas'. It has even been said that the only permanent acquisition that England owed directly to him was her Canadian dominion; and, strictly speaking, this is true, it being admitted that the campaign by which the Indian empire was virtually won was not planned by him, although brought to a successful issue during his ministry.[40]\", \"But materialaggrandisement, although the only tangible, was not the only real or lasting effect of a war policy. More could be gained by crushing a formidable rival than by conquering a province. The loss of her Canadian possessions was only one of a series of disasters suffered by France, which included the victories at sea ofBoscawenatLagosandHawkeatQuiberon Bay. Such defeats radically affected the future of Europe and the world. Deprived of her most valuable colonies both in theEastand in theWest, and thoroughly defeated on the continent, France's humiliation was the beginning of a new epoch in history.[40]\", \"The victorious policy of Pitt destroyed the military prestige which repeated experience has shown to be in France as in no other country the very life of monarchy, and thus was not the least of the influences that slowly brought about theFrench Revolution. It effectually deprived France of the lead in the councils of Europe which she had hitherto arrogated to herself, and so affected the whole course of continental politics. It is such far-reaching results as these, and not the mere acquisition of a single colony, however valuable, that constitute Pitt's claim to be considered as the most powerful minister that ever guided the foreign policy of England.[40]\", 'Resignation', 'George II died on 25 October 1760, and was succeeded by his grandson,George III. The new king was inclined to view politics in personal terms and taught to believe that \"Pitt had the blackest of hearts\". The new king had counsellors of his own, led byLord Bute. Bute soon joined the cabinet as aNorthern Secretaryand Pitt and he were quickly in dispute over a number of issues.', \"In 1761 Pitt had received information from his agents about a secretBourbon Family Compactby which theBourbonsof France and Spain bound themselves in an offensive alliance against Britain.[62]Spain was concerned that Britain's victories over France had left them too powerful, and were a threat in the long term to Spain'sown empire. Equally they may have believed that the British had become overstretched by fighting a global war and decided to try to seizeBritish possessionssuch asJamaica. A secret convention pledged that if Britain and France were still at war by 1 May 1762, Spain would enter the war on the French side.[66]\", \"Pitt urged that such a clear threat should be met by a pre-emptive strike against Spain's navy and her colonies—with emphasis on speed to prevent Spain bringing the annualManila galleonsafely to harbour. Bute and Newcastle refused to support such a move, as did the entire cabinet exceptTemple, believing it would make Britain look the aggressor against Spain potentially provoking other neutral nations to declare war on Britain. Pitt believed he had no choice but to leave a cabinet in which his advice on a vital question had been rejected and presented his resignation. Many of his cabinet colleagues secretly welcomed his departure as they believed his dominance and popularity were a threat to the Constitution.[67]Pitt's brother-in-lawGeorge Grenvillewas given a major role in government, angering Pitt who felt Grenville should have resigned with him. Pitt regarded Grenville's action as a betrayal and there was hostility between them for several years.\", 'After Pitt\\'s resignation in October 1761, the King urged Pitt to accept a mark of royal favour. Accordingly, he obtained a pension of £3000 a year and his wife,Lady Hester Grenvillewas createdBaroness Chathamin her own right—although Pitt refused to accept a title himself. Pitt assured the King that he would not go into direct opposition against the government. His conduct after his retirement was distinguished by a moderation and disinterestedness which, asEdmund Burkeremarked, \"set a seal upon his character\". The war with Spain, in which he had urged the cabinet to take the initiative, proved inevitable; but he scorned to use the occasion for \"altercation and recrimination\", and spoke in support of the government measures for carrying on the war.[62]', 'Twenty years after he had received a similar windfall from the Marlborough legacy,Sir William Pynsent, Bt., aSomersetbaronetto whom he was personally quite unknown, left him his entire estate, worth about three thousand a year, in testimony of approval of his political career.[18][68]', 'Prime Minister (1766-1768)', 'Chatham Ministry', 'In July 1766 Rockingham was dismissed, and Pitt was entrusted by the King with the task of forming a government entirely of his own selection.[62]His principle, \"measures not men\", appealed to the King whom he proposed to serve by \"destroying all party distinctions\". Pitt made appointments based not on connections but on merit, such asCharles Townshendto theExchequerandShelburneas Secretary of State, to order American affairs. Pitt chose for himself the office ofLord Privy Seal, which required his elevation to theHouse of Lords, and on 4 August he becameEarl ofChathamin the county of KentandViscount Pitt ofBurton Pynsentin the county of Somerset.[69]', 'Pitt\\'s decision to accept apeeragewas likely influenced by his declining health and desire for a less demanding role, but the \"great commoner\" lost a great deal of public support.[70]For example, in view of his probable accession to power, preparations were made in theCity of Londonfor a banquet and a general illumination to celebrate the event, but the celebration was at once countermanded when it was known that he had become Earl of Chatham.[62]', 'Edmund Burkedescribed the administration as \"chequered and speckled\", and spoke of it as \"patriots and courtiers, King\\'s friends and republicans; Whigs and Tories\\xa0 ... indeed a very curious show, but utterly unsafe to touch and unsure to stand on\".[71]', 'Economic policy', \"The problems facing the government included the observance of theTreaty of Parisby France and Spain, tension between American colonists and the mother country, and the status of theEast India Company. One of the new ministry's earliest acts was to lay anembargouponcorn, which was thought necessary in order to prevent a dearth resulting from the unprecedented bad harvest of 1766. The measure was strongly opposed, and Lord Chatham delivered his first speech in the House of Lords in support of it. It proved to be almost the only measure introduced by his government in which he personally interested himself.[62]\", 'Colonial policy', \"In 1767, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, enacteddutiesin the American colonies on tea, paper, and other goods. The taxes were created without the consultation of Chatham and possibly against his wishes. They proved offensive to the American colonists. Chatham's attention had been directed to the growing importance of the affairs of India, and there is evidence in his correspondence that he was meditating a comprehensive scheme for transferring much of the power of theEast India Companyto the crown. Yet he was incapacitated physically and mentally during nearly his entire tenure of office.[72]Chatham rarely saw any of his colleagues although they repeatedly and urgently pressed for interviews with him, and even an offer from the King to visit him in person was respectfully declined. While his gout seemed to improve, he was newly afflicted withmental alienationbordering oninsanity.[62]Chatham's lack of leadership resulted in an incohesive set of policies.\", 'Resignation', 'Chatham dismissed his alliesAmherstand Shelburne from their posts, and then in October 1768 he tendered his own resignation on the grounds of poor health, leaving the leadership toGrafton, hisFirst Lord of the Treasury.', 'Later life', 'Soon after his resignation a renewed attack of gout freed Chatham from the mental disease under which he had so long suffered. He had been nearly two years and a half in seclusion when, in July 1769, he again appeared in public at a royal levee. It was not, however, until 1770 that he resumed his seat in the House of Lords.[73]', 'Falklands Crisis', 'The same year when Britain and Spain became involved in theFalklands Crisisand came close to war, Pitt was a staunch advocate of taking a tough stance with Madrid and Paris (as he had been during the earlierCorsican Crisiswhen Francehad invaded Corsica) and made a number of speeches on the subject rousing public opinion.[74]The government ofLord Northwas pushed into taking a firmer line because of this, mobilising the navy, and forcing Spain to back down. Some had even believed that the issue was enough to cast North from office and restore Pitt as Prime Minister—although the ultimate result was to strengthen the position of North who took credit for his firm handling of the crisis and was able to fill the cabinet with his own supporters. North would go on to dominate politics for the next decade, leading the country until 1782.', 'War of American Independence', 'Chatham sought to find a compromise on the escalating conflict with the American colonies.  As he realised the gravity of the American situation, Chatham re-entered the fray, declaring that he would \"be in earnest for the public\" and \"a scarecrow of violence to the gentler warblers of the grove\".[75]His position changed from an obsession in 1774 with the question of the authority of Parliament to a search for a formula for conciliation in 1775. He proposed the \"Provisional Act\" that would both maintain the ultimate authority of Parliamentary sovereignty, while meeting the colonial demands. The Lords defeated his proposal on 1 February 1775.  Chatham\\'s warnings regarding America were ignored. His brave efforts to present his case, passionate, deeply pondered, for the concession of fundamental liberties—no taxation without consent, independent judges, trial by jury, along with the recognition of the AmericanContinental Congress—foundered on the arrogance and complacency of his peers.[76]After war had broken out, he warned thatAmericacould not be conquered.[77]Due to his stance, Pitt was very popular amongst the American colonists. This high esteem approached to idolatry according to historianClinton Rossiter:', 'In the last decade of the colonial period the ideal of the man of public virtue was made real in the person of William Pitt. The cult of this noblest of Whigs, \"the Genius of England and the Comet of his Age\" was well advanced toward idolatry at least five years before the Stamp Act. The greatest of \"the great men of England\", the last and noblest of the Romans, was considered the embodiment of virtue, wisdom, patriotism, liberty, and temperance\\xa0 ... Pitt, \"glorious and immortal\", the \"guardian of America\", was the idol of the colonies\\xa0 ... ASon of Libertyin Bristol County, Massachusetts, paid him the ultimate tribute of identification with English liberty: \"Our toast in general is,—Magna Charta, theBritish Constitution,—PITTand Liberty forever!\"[78]', 'Death', \"Pitt had now almost no personal following, mainly owing to the grave mistake he had made in not forming an alliance with the Rockingham party, but his eloquence was as powerful as ever, and all its power was directed against the government policy in the contest with America, which had become the question of all-absorbing interest. His last appearance in the House of Lords was on 7 April 1778, on the occasion of theDuke of Richmond's motion for an address praying the king to conclude peace with America on any terms.[73]\", 'In view of the hostile demonstrations of France the various parties had come generally to see the necessity of such a measure but Chatham could not brook the thought of a step which implied submission to the \"natural enemy\" whom it had been the main object of his life to humble, and he declaimed for a considerable time, although with diminished vigour, against the motion. After the Duke of Richmond had replied, he rose again excitedly as if to speak, pressed his hand upon his breast, and fell down in a fit.[73]His last words before he collapsed were: \"My Lords, any state is better than despair; if we must fall, let us fall like men.\"James HarrisMP, however, recorded thatLord Nugenthad told him that Chatham\\'s last words in the Lords were: \"If the Americans defend independence, they shall find me in their way\" and that his very last words (spoken tohis soldier son John) were: \"Leave your dying father, and go to the defence of your country\".[79]', \"He was moved to his home at Hayes, where his middle sonWilliamread to himHomer's passage about the death ofHector. Chatham died on 11 May 1778, aged 69. Although he was initially buried at Hayes, all parties combined to show their sense of the national loss and the Commons presented an address to the king praying that the deceased statesman might be buried with the honours of a public funeral. A sum was voted for a public monument which was erected over a new grave inWestminster Abbey.[80]The monument, by the sculptorJohn Bacon, has a figure of Pitt above statues ofBritanniaandNeptunewith figures representing Prudence, Fortitude, the Earth and also a sea creature.[81]\", 'In theGuildhallEdmund Burke\\'s inscription summed up what he had meant to the city: he was \"the minister by whom commerce was united with and made to flourish by war\". Soon after the funeral a bill was passed bestowing a pension of £4,000 a year on his successors in theearldom. He had a family of three sons and two daughters, of whom the second son,William, became prime minister in 1783.[73]', 'Legacy', 'Horace Walpole, not an uncritical admirer, wrote of Pitt:', 'It were ingratitude to him to say that he did not give such a reverberation to our stagnating councils, as exceedingly altered the appearance of our fortune. He warded off the evil hour that seemed approaching, he infused vigour into our arms, he taught the nation to speak again as England used to speak to foreign powers\\xa0 ... Pitt, on entering upon administration, had found the nation at the lowest ebb in point of power and reputation\\xa0 ... France, who meant to be feared, was feared heartily\\xa0 ... They were willing to trust that France would be so good as to ruin us by inches. Pitt had roused us from this ignoble lethargy\\xa0 ... The admirers of Mr Pitt extol the reverberation he gave to our councils, the despondence he banished, the spirit he infused, the conquests he made, the security he affixed to our trade and plantations, the humiliation of France, the glory of Britain carried under his administration to a pitch at which it never had arrived—and all this is exactly true.[82]', 'Samuel Johnsonis reported to have said that \"Walpole was a minister given by the king to the people, but Pitt was a minister given by the people to the king\", and the remark correctly indicated Chatham\\'s distinctive place among English statesmen. He was the first minister whose main strength lay in the support of the nation at large as distinct from its representatives in the Commons, where his personal following was always small. He was the first to discern that public opinion, though generally slow to form and slow to act, is in the end the paramount power in the state; and he was the first to use it not in an emergency merely, but throughout a whole political career.[73]', 'Chatham marked the commencement of that vast change in the movement ofEnglish politicsby which it came about that the sentiment of the great mass of the people then told effectively on the action of the government from day to day—almost from hour to hour. He was well fitted to secure the sympathy and admiration of his countrymen, for his virtues and his failings were alike English. He was often inconsistent, he was generally intractable and overbearing, and he was always pompous and affected to a degree which, asMacaulayremarked, seemed scarcely compatible with true greatness.[73]', 'Of the last quality evidence was furnished in the stilted style of his letters, and in the fact recorded byThomas Sewardthat he never permitted his under-secretaries to sit in his presence. Burke spoke of \"some significant, pompous, creeping, explanatory, ambiguous matter, in the true Chathamic style\". But these defects were known only to the inner circle of his associates.[73][83]', 'To the outside public he was endeared as a statesman who could do or suffer \"nothing base\", and who had the rare power of transfusing his own indomitable energy and courage into all who served under him. \"A spirited foreign policy\" has always been popular in England, and Pitt was the most popular of English ministers, because he was the most successful exponent of such a policy. In domestic affairs his influence was small and almost entirely indirect. He himself confessed his unfitness for dealing with questions of finance. The commercial prosperity that was produced by his war policy was in a great part delusive, as prosperity so produced must always be, although it had permanent effects of the highest moment in the rise of such centres of industry as Glasgow. This, however, was a remote result which he could have neither intended nor foreseen.[73]', 'It has been suggested that Pitt was in fact a far more orthodox Whig than has been historically portrayed demonstrated by his sitting for rotten borough seats controlled by aristocratic magnates, and his lifelong concern for protecting thebalance of poweron the European continent, which marked him out from many other Patriots.[84]', 'Historians[who?]such as Caleb Carr have described Pitt as \"the greatest British statesman of the eighteenth century\".[85]He is immortalised inSt Stephen\\'s Hall, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.[86]', \"The American city ofPittsburgh, originallyFort Duquesne, was renamed for Pitt after it was captured from the French during the Seven Years' War.\", 'Family and personal life', 'Pitt marriedLady Hester Grenville(1720–1803), daughter of the1st Countess Temple, on 16 November 1754 byFrancis Ayscoughunder special licence at her home inArgyle Street, London.[87][88]', 'They had five children, born at Hayes:[89]', 'Lady Hester Pitt(19 October 1755\\xa0– 20 July 1780), who marriedViscount Mahon, later the 3rdEarl Stanhope, on 19 December 1774; three children, including the traveler and ArabistLady Hester Stanhope', 'John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham(1756–1835), who marriedThe Hon.

Historically, they emerged in theearly Middle Agesfrom an amalgamation of twoCeltic peoples, thePictsandGaels, who founded theKingdom of Scotland(orAlba) in the 9th century. In the following two centuries, Celtic-speakingCumbriansofStrathclydeand Germanic-speakingAnglesofNorthumbriabecame part of Scotland. In theHigh Middle Ages, during the 12th-centuryDavidian Revolution, small numbers ofNormannobles migrated to the Lowlands. In the 13th century, theNorse-Gaelsof theWestern Islesbecame part of Scotland, followed by theNorseof theNorthern Islesin the 15th century.', 'In modern usage, \"Scottish people\" or \"Scots\" refers to anyone whose linguistic, cultural, family ancestral or genetic origins are from Scotland. TheLatinwordScoti[14]originally referred to the Gaels, but came to describe all inhabitants of Scotland.[15]Consideredpejorativeby some,[16]the termScotchhas also been used for Scottish people, now primarily outwith Scotland.', \"People of Scottish descent live in many countries. Emigration, influenced by factors such as theHighlandandLowland Clearances, Scottish emigration to various locales throughout theBritish Empire, and latterlyindustrial declineand unemployment, have resulted in the spread ofScottish languagesandculture. Large populations of Scottish people settled the 'New World' lands ofNorthand South America, Australia andNew Zealand. The highest concentrations of people of Scottish descent in the world outside of Scotland are inNova ScotiaandPrince Edward Islandin Canada,OtagoandMurihiku/Southlandin New Zealand, theFalkland Islands, andNorthern Irelandin the United Kingdom. Canada has the highest level of Scottish descendants per capita in the world and the second-largest population of Scottish descendants, after the United States.[17]\", 'Etymology', 'Originally the Romans used Scotia to refer to Ireland.[18][19][20]The Venerable Bede(c.672or 673 – 27 May, 735) uses the wordScottorumfor the nation from Ireland who settled part of thePictishlands: \"Scottorum nationem in Pictorum parte recipit.\" This can be inferred to mean the arrival of the people, also known as theGaels, in the Kingdom of Dál Riata, in the western edge of Scotland. Bede used the wordnatio(nation) for the Scots, where he often refers to other peoples, such as the Picts, with the wordgens(race).[21]In the 10th-centuryAnglo-Saxon Chronicle, the wordScotis mentioned as a reference to the \"Land of the Gaels\". The wordScottorumwas again used by an Irish king in 1005:Imperator Scottorumwas the title given toBrian Bórumaby his notary, Mael Suthain, in theBook of Armagh.[22]This style was subsequently copied by the Scottish kings.BasileusScottorumappears on the great seal ofKing Edgar(1074–1107).[23]Alexander I(c.1078–1124) used the wordsRexScottorumon his great seal, as did many of his successors up to and includingJames VI.[24]', 'In modern times, the wordsScotandScottishare applied mainly to inhabitants of Scotland. The possible ancient Irish connotations are largely forgotten.

It is also the annual venue of theGeneral Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine,Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. TheUniversity of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world.

The City of Edinburgh council area had an estimated population of 514,990 in mid-2021,[9]and includes outlying towns and villages which are not part of Edinburgh proper. The city is in theLothianregion and was historically part of theshireofMidlothian(also called Edinburghshire).', 'Etymology', '\"Edin\", the root of the city\\'s name, derives fromEidyn, the name for the region inCumbric, theBrittonicCelticlanguage formerly spoken there. The name\\'s meaning is unknown.[21]The district of Eidyn was centred on the stronghold of Din Eidyn, thedunorhillfortof Eidyn.[21]This stronghold is believed to have been located atCastle Rock,[citation needed]now the site ofEdinburgh Castle. A siege of Din Eidyn byOswald, king of theAnglesofNorthumbriain 638 marked the beginning of three centuries of Germanic influence in south east Scotland that laid the foundations for the development ofScots, before the town was ultimately subsumed in 954 by the kingdom known to the English as Scotland.[22]As the language shifted from Cumbric toNorthumbrian Old Englishand thenScots, the Brittonicdinin Din Eidyn was replaced byburh, producingEdinburgh. InScottish Gaelicdinbecomesdùn, producing modernDùn Èideann.[21][23]', 'Nicknames', 'The city is affectionately nicknamedAuld Reekie,[24][25]Scots forOld Smoky, for the views from the country of the smoke-covered Old Town. A note in a collection of the works of the poet,Allan Ramsay, explains, \"Auld Reeky...A name the country people give Edinburgh, from the cloud of smoke or reek that is always impending over it.\"[26]InWalter Scott\\'s 1820 novelThe Abbot, a character observes that \"yonder stands Auld Reekie—you may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles\\' distance\".[27]In 1898,Thomas Carlylecomments on the phenomenon: \"Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh, for, ever sinceAeneas Silvius\\'s time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called \\'Auld Reekie\\' by the country people\".[28]The 19th-century historianRobert Chambersasserted that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign ofCharles IIin the late 17th century. He attributed the name to aFifelaird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. \"It\\'s time now bairns, to tak\\' the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonder\\'s Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht -cap!\".[29]', 'Edinburgh has been popularly called theAthens of the Northsince the early 19th century.[30]References to Athens, such asAthens of BritainandModern Athens, had been made as early as the 1760s. The similarities were seen to be topographical but also intellectual. Edinburgh\\'s Castle Rock reminded returninggrand touristsof theAthenianAcropolis, as did aspects of theneoclassical architectureand layout ofNew Town.[30]Both cities had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to aportseveral miles away (respectively,LeithandPiraeus). Intellectually, theScottish Enlightenment, with itshumanistandrationalistoutlook, was influenced byAncient Greek philosophy.[31]In 1822, artistHugh William Williamsorganized an exhibition that showed his paintings of Athens alongside views of Edinburgh, and the idea of a direct parallel between both cities quickly caught the popular imagination.[32]When plans were drawn up in the early 19th century to architecturally developCalton Hill, the design of theNational Monumentdirectly copied Athens\\'Parthenon.[33]Tom Stoppard\\'s character Archie ofJumperssaid, perhaps playing onReykjavíkmeaning \"smoky bay\", that the \"Reykjavík of the South\" would be more appropriate.[34]', 'The city has also been known by severalLatin names, such asEdinburgum, while the adjectival formsEdinburgensisandEdinensisare used in educational and scientific contexts.[35][36]', 'Edinais a late 18th-century poetical form used by the Scots poetsRobert FergussonandRobert Burns. \"Embra\" or \"Embro\" are colloquialisms from the same time,[37]as inRobert Garioch\\'sEmbro to the Ploy.[38]', 'Ben Jonsondescribed it as \"Britaine\\'s other eye\",[39]and Sir Walter Scott referred to it as \"yon Empress of the North\".[40]Robert Louis Stevenson, also a son of the city, wrote that Edinburgh \"is what Paris ought to be\".[41]', 'History', 'Early history', \"The earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area was atCramond, where evidence was found of aMesolithiccamp site dated to c. 8500 BC.[42]Traces of laterBronze AgeandIron Agesettlements have been found on Castle Rock,Arthur's Seat,Craiglockhart Hilland thePentland Hills.[43]\", \"When theRomansarrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found aBrittonicCeltic tribe whose name they recorded as theVotadini.[44]The Votadini transitioned into theGododdinkingdom in theEarly Middle Ages, with Eidyn serving as one of the kingdom's districts. During this period, the Castle Rock site, thought to have been the stronghold of Din Eidyn, emerged as the kingdom's major centre.[45]The medieval poemY Gododdindescribes a war band from across the Brittonic world who gathered in Eidyn before a fateful raid; this may describe a historical event around AD 600.[46][47][48]\", 'In 638, the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal toKing OswaldofNorthumbria, and around this time control of Lothian passed to theAngles. Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950, when, during the reign ofIndulf, son ofConstantine II, the \"burh\" (fortress), named in the 10th-centuryPictish Chronicleasoppidum Eden,[49]was abandoned to the Scots.

When theEnglish invaded Scotland in 1298,Edward I of Englandchose not to enter Edinburgh but passed by it with his army.[55]', 'In the middle of the 14th century, the French chroniclerJean Froissartdescribed it as the capital of Scotland (c. 1365), andJames III(1451–88) referred to it in the 15th century as \"the principal burgh of our kingdom\".[56]In 1482 James III \"granted and perpetually confirmed to the said Provost, Bailies, Clerk, Council, and Community, and their successors, the office ofSheriffwithin the Burgh for ever, to be exercised by the Provost for the time as Sheriff, and by the Bailies for the time as Sheriffsdepute conjunctly and severally; with full power to hold Courts, to punish transgressors not only by banishment but by death, to appoint officers of Court, and to do everything else appertaining to the office of Sheriff; as also to apply to their own proper use the fines and escheats arising out of the exercise of the said office.\"[57]Despite beingburnt by the Englishin 1544, Edinburgh continued to develop and grow,[58]and was at the centre of events in the 16th-centuryScottish Reformation[59]and 17th-centuryWars of the Covenant.[60]In 1582, Edinburgh\\'s town council was given aroyal charterby KingJames VIpermitting the establishment of a university;[61]founded asTounis College(Town\\'s College), the institution developed into theUniversity of Edinburgh, which contributed to Edinburgh\\'s central intellectual role in subsequent centuries.[62]', '17th century', \"In 1603, KingJames VIof Scotland succeeded to the English throne, uniting the crowns of Scotland and England in apersonal unionknown as theUnion of the Crowns, though Scotland remained, in all other respects, a separate kingdom.[63]In 1638,King Charles I'sattempt to introduceAnglicanchurch forms in Scotland encountered stiffPresbyterianopposition culminating in the conflicts of theWars of the Three Kingdoms.[64]Subsequent Scottish support forCharles Stuart's restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburgh's occupation byOliver Cromwell'sCommonwealth of Englandforces – theNew Model Army– in 1650.[65]\", \"In the 17th century, Edinburgh's boundaries were still defined by the city's defensivetown walls. As a result, the city's growing population was accommodated by increasing the height of the houses. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common,[66]and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper.[67][68]Most of these old structures were replaced by the predominantlyVictorianbuildings seen in today's Old Town. In 1611 an act of parliament created theHigh Constables of Edinburghto keep order in the city, thought to be the oldest statutory police force in the world.[69]\", '18th century', 'Following theTreaty of Unionin 1706, the Parliaments of England and Scotland passedActs of Unionin 1706 and 1707 respectively, uniting the two kingdoms in theKingdom of Great Britaineffective from 1 May 1707.[70]As a consequence, theParliament of Scotlandmerged with theParliament of Englandto form theParliament of Great Britain, which sat atWestminsterin London. The Union was opposed by many Scots, resulting in riots in the city.[71]', \"By the first half of the 18th century, Edinburgh was described as one of Europe's most densely populated, overcrowded and unsanitary towns.[72][73]Visitors were struck by the fact that the social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the sametenementbuildings; although here a form of social segregation did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.[74]\", 'During theJacobite rising of 1745, Edinburgh was briefly occupied by the Jacobite \"Highland Army\" before its march into England.[75]After its eventual defeat atCulloden, there followed a period of reprisals and pacification, largely directed at the rebelliousclans.[76]In Edinburgh, the Town Council, keen to emulate London by initiating city improvements and expansion to the north of the castle,[77]reaffirmed its belief in the Union and loyalty to theHanoverianmonarchGeorge IIIby its choice of names for the streets of the New Town: for example,RoseStreet andThistleStreet; and for the royal family,George Street,Queen Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street andPrinces Street(in honour of George\\'s two sons).[78]The consistently geometric layout of the plan for the extension of Edinburgh was the result of a major competition in urban planning staged by the Town Council in 1766.[79]', 'In the second half of the century, the city was at the heart of theScottish Enlightenment,[80]when thinkers like David Hume, Adam Smith,James HuttonandJoseph Blackwere familiar figures in its streets. Edinburgh became a major intellectual centre, earning it the nickname \"Athens of the North\" because of its manyneo-classicalbuildings and reputation for learning, recalling ancient Athens.[81]In the 18th-century novelThe Expedition of Humphry ClinkerbyTobias Smollettone character describes Edinburgh as a \"hotbed of genius\".[82]Edinburgh was also a major centre for the Scottish book trade. The highly successful London booksellerAndrew Millarwas apprenticed there to James McEuen.[83]', 'From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant \"one-family\" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city\\'s social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, \"Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented.\"[84]', '19th and 20th centuries', \"Despite an enduring myth to the contrary,[85]Edinburgh became an industrial centre[86]with its traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continuing to grow in the 19th century and joined by new industries such asrubber works,engineering worksand others. By 1821, Edinburgh had been overtaken byGlasgowas Scotland's largest city.[87]The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates.[88]Improvements carried out under Lord ProvostWilliam Chambersin the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantlyVictorianOld Town seen today.[89]More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work ofPatrick Geddes,[90]but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before majorslum clearancein the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments which transformed theGeorge Squareand Potterrow areas proved highly controversial.[91]\", 'Since the 1990s a new \"financial district\", including theEdinburgh International Conference Centre, has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching intoFountainbridge, a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises. This ongoing development has enabled Edinburgh to maintain its place as the United Kingdom\\'s second largest financial and administrative centre after London.[92][93]Financial services now account for a third of all commercial office space in the city.[94]The development ofEdinburgh Park, a new business and technology park covering 38 acres (15\\xa0ha), 4\\xa0mi (6\\xa0km) west of the city centre, has also contributed to the District Council\\'s strategy for the city\\'s major economic regeneration.[94]', 'In 1998, theScotland Act, which came into force the following year, established adevolvedScottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (renamed the Scottish Government since September 2007[95]).

Examples of these independent wedges of green belt includeHolyrood Parkand Corstorphine Hill.[108]', 'Areas', 'Early settlements', 'Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.[109]Many areas, such asDalry, contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known astenements, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been less built-up with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.[110]', 'The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe ofPrinces Street Gardens.

In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[87]', \"In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, theAmerican Lung Associationranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[88][89]The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel'sClairton Coke Works, the nation's largestcokemill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[90]The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[91]\", 'Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[92]ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It\\'s the best it\\'s been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ...

The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[94]\", \"Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average.[95]The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.[95]Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh.[95]The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities.[95]This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[96]\", 'Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh.[97]WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education.[97]In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[98]', 'Water quality', 'The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[99]This is caused byfrequently overflowing untreated sewageinto local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has acombined sewersystem, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[100]Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[101]As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[102]Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[103]The local sewage authority,Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from theEPAto come up with solutions.[104]In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2\\xa0billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.[105][106]', \"Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority(PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[107]In 2017,Mayor William Pedutoadvocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[108]Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[107]\", \"PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water.[109]Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels.[110]In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties.[111]By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality.[111]Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014,[110]from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection.[112]Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water.[112]\", 'In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water.[112]Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit.[110]In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia.[111]In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[113]Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water.[113]PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[113]', 'There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system.[114]Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[114]Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.[115]', 'Demographics', '2020 census', \"At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.Non-Hispanic whiteswere 64.8% of the population in 2010,[119]compared to 78.7% in 1970.[120]By the2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[118]Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.\", 'Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American.

An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950.[13]Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now.[142]These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.[13]\", 'In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.[145]', 'Economy', 'Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[87]', \"In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, theAmerican Lung Associationranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[88][89]The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel'sClairton Coke Works, the nation's largestcokemill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[90]The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[91]\", 'Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[92]ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It\\'s the best it\\'s been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ...

The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[94]\", \"Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average.[95]The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.[95]Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh.[95]The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities.[95]This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[96]\", 'Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh.[97]WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education.[97]In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[98]', 'Water quality', 'The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[99]This is caused byfrequently overflowing untreated sewageinto local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has acombined sewersystem, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[100]Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[101]As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[102]Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[103]The local sewage authority,Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from theEPAto come up with solutions.[104]In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2\\xa0billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.[105][106]', \"Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority(PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[107]In 2017,Mayor William Pedutoadvocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[108]Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[107]\", \"PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water.[109]Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels.[110]In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties.[111]By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality.[111]Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014,[110]from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection.[112]Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water.[112]\", 'In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water.[112]Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit.[110]In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia.[111]In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[113]Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water.[113]PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[113]', 'There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system.[114]Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[114]Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.[115]', 'Demographics', '2020 census', \"At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.Non-Hispanic whiteswere 64.8% of the population in 2010,[119]compared to 78.7% in 1970.[120]By the2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[118]Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.\", 'Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American.

An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950.[13]Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now.[142]These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.[13]\", 'In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.[145]', 'Economy', 'Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[87]', \"In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, theAmerican Lung Associationranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[88][89]The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel'sClairton Coke Works, the nation's largestcokemill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[90]The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[91]\", 'Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[92]ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It\\'s the best it\\'s been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ...

Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[94]\", \"Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average.[95]The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.[95]Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh.[95]The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities.[95]This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[96]\", 'Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh.[97]WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education.[97]In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[98]', 'Water quality', 'The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[99]This is caused byfrequently overflowing untreated sewageinto local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has acombined sewersystem, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[100]Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[101]As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[102]Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[103]The local sewage authority,Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from theEPAto come up with solutions.[104]In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2\\xa0billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.[105][106]', \"Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority(PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[107]In 2017,Mayor William Pedutoadvocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[108]Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[107]\", \"PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water.[109]Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels.[110]In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties.[111]By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality.[111]Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014,[110]from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection.[112]Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water.[112]\", 'In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water.[112]Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit.[110]In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia.[111]In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[113]Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water.[113]PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[113]', 'There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system.[114]Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[114]Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.[115]', 'Demographics', '2020 census', \"At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.Non-Hispanic whiteswere 64.8% of the population in 2010,[119]compared to 78.7% in 1970.[120]By the2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[118]Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.\", 'Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American.

An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950.[13]Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now.[142]These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.[13]\", 'In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.[145]', 'Economy', 'Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

There were active stations of theUnderground Railroadin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[40]The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[41]Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties.

In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[87]', \"In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, theAmerican Lung Associationranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[88][89]The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel'sClairton Coke Works, the nation's largestcokemill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[90]The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[91]\", 'Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[92]ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It\\'s the best it\\'s been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ...

The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[94]\", \"Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average.[95]The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.[95]Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh.[95]The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities.[95]This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[96]\", 'Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh.[97]WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education.[97]In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[98]', 'Water quality', 'The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[99]This is caused byfrequently overflowing untreated sewageinto local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has acombined sewersystem, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[100]Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[101]As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[102]Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[103]The local sewage authority,Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from theEPAto come up with solutions.[104]In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2\\xa0billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.[105][106]', \"Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority(PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates.

The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water.[112]Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit.[110]In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia.[111]In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[113]Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water.[113]PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[113]', 'There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system.[114]Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[114]Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit.

An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950.[13]Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now.[142]These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.[13]\", 'In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.[145]', 'Economy', 'Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

According toGeorge Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerlyHerr's Island, in what is now theLawrencevilleneighborhood.[25]:\\u200a289\", '18th century', 'The first known European to enter the region was the French explorerRobert de La SallefromQuebecduring his 1669 expedition down theOhio River.[26][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year Europeanfur tradersestablished area posts and settlements.[27]', 'In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to uniteCanadawithFrench Louisianavia the rivers.[27]During 1753–1754, the British hastily builtFort Prince Georgebefore a larger French force drove them off. The French builtFort Duquesnebased on LaSalle\\'s 1669 claims. TheFrench and Indian War, the North American front of theSeven Years\\' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British GeneralEdward Braddockwas dispatched with MajorGeorge Washingtonas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[28]The British and colonial force were defeated atBraddock\\'s Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction onFort Pitt, named afterWilliam Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[29]', \"DuringPontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribeslaid siege to Fort Pittin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after ColonelHenry Bouquetdefeated a portion of the besieging force at theBattle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[30][31][32][33]\", 'During this period, the powerful nations of theIroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768Treaty of Fort Stanwix, thePennswere allowed to purchase the modern region from theIroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[34]Both theColony of Virginiaand theProvince of Pennsylvaniaclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend theMason–Dixon linewestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,Bedford County, Pennsylvaniawas created to govern the frontier.', \"On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created asPitt Township.[35][36]William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[37]\", 'Following theAmerican Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of theOhio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, thePittsburgh Post-Gazettewas started, and in 1787, thePittsburgh Academywas chartered. Unrest during theWhiskey Rebellionof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing theAppalachian Mountainsor through theGreat Lakes.Fort Pitt(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into theNorthwest Territory.', '19th century', 'The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for theLewis and Clark Expedition.[38]Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 whenMeriwether Lewispurchased akeelboatthat would later be used to ascend theMissouri River.[39]', 'TheWar of 1812cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.', \"In the 1830s, manyWelsh peoplefrom theMerthyrsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of theMerthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of theAllegheny Mountains. TheGreat Fire of Pittsburghdestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape theGreat Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\\xa0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming fromGermany.\", \"Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of theUnderground Railroadin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[40]The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[41]Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[40]\", \"TheAmerican Civil Warboosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.Andrew Carnegiebegan steel production in 1875 at theEdgar Thomson Steel WorksinNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into theCarnegie Steel Company.

An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950.[13]Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now.[142]These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.[13]\", 'In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification.

As Forbes was aScotsman, he probably pronounced the name/ˈpɪtsbərə/PITS-bər-ə(similar toEdinburgh).[18][19]', 'Pittsburgh was incorporated as aboroughon April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[20]\"Be it enacted by thePennsylvania State SenateandPennsylvania House of Representativesof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[21]', 'From 1891 to 1911, the city\\'s name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the finalhwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[22][18]After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop thehwas reversed.[18]ThePittsburg Presscontinued spelling the city without anhuntil 1921.[23]', 'History', 'Kingdom of France1690s–1763Great Britain1681–1781United States1776–present', 'Native Americans', \"The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by theShawneeand several other settled groups ofNative Americans.[24]Shannopin's Townwas an 18th-centuryLenape(Delaware) town located roughly from wherePenn Avenueis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According toGeorge Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerlyHerr's Island, in what is now theLawrencevilleneighborhood.[25]:\\u200a289\", '18th century', 'The first known European to enter the region was the French explorerRobert de La SallefromQuebecduring his 1669 expedition down theOhio River.[26][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year Europeanfur tradersestablished area posts and settlements.[27]', 'In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to uniteCanadawithFrench Louisianavia the rivers.[27]During 1753–1754, the British hastily builtFort Prince Georgebefore a larger French force drove them off. The French builtFort Duquesnebased on LaSalle\\'s 1669 claims. TheFrench and Indian War, the North American front of theSeven Years\\' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British GeneralEdward Braddockwas dispatched with MajorGeorge Washingtonas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[28]The British and colonial force were defeated atBraddock\\'s Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction onFort Pitt, named afterWilliam Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[29]', \"DuringPontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribeslaid siege to Fort Pittin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after ColonelHenry Bouquetdefeated a portion of the besieging force at theBattle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[30][31][32][33]\", 'During this period, the powerful nations of theIroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768Treaty of Fort Stanwix, thePennswere allowed to purchase the modern region from theIroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[34]Both theColony of Virginiaand theProvince of Pennsylvaniaclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend theMason–Dixon linewestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,Bedford County, Pennsylvaniawas created to govern the frontier.', \"On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created asPitt Township.[35][36]William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[37]\", 'Following theAmerican Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of theOhio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, thePittsburgh Post-Gazettewas started, and in 1787, thePittsburgh Academywas chartered. Unrest during theWhiskey Rebellionof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing theAppalachian Mountainsor through theGreat Lakes.Fort Pitt(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into theNorthwest Territory.', '19th century', 'The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for theLewis and Clark Expedition.[38]Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 whenMeriwether Lewispurchased akeelboatthat would later be used to ascend theMissouri River.[39]', 'TheWar of 1812cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.', \"In the 1830s, manyWelsh peoplefrom theMerthyrsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of theMerthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of theAllegheny Mountains. TheGreat Fire of Pittsburghdestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape theGreat Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\\xa0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming fromGermany.\", \"Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city.

Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.[145]', 'Economy', 'Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

As Forbes was aScotsman, he probably pronounced the name/ˈpɪtsbərə/PITS-bər-ə(similar toEdinburgh).[18][19]', 'Pittsburgh was incorporated as aboroughon April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[20]\"Be it enacted by thePennsylvania State SenateandPennsylvania House of Representativesof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[21]', 'From 1891 to 1911, the city\\'s name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the finalhwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[22][18]After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop thehwas reversed.[18]ThePittsburg Presscontinued spelling the city without anhuntil 1921.[23]', 'History', 'Kingdom of France1690s–1763Great Britain1681–1781United States1776–present', 'Native Americans', \"The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by theShawneeand several other settled groups ofNative Americans.[24]Shannopin's Townwas an 18th-centuryLenape(Delaware) town located roughly from wherePenn Avenueis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According toGeorge Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerlyHerr's Island, in what is now theLawrencevilleneighborhood.[25]:\\u200a289\", '18th century', 'The first known European to enter the region was the French explorerRobert de La SallefromQuebecduring his 1669 expedition down theOhio River.[26][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year Europeanfur tradersestablished area posts and settlements.[27]', 'In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to uniteCanadawithFrench Louisianavia the rivers.[27]During 1753–1754, the British hastily builtFort Prince Georgebefore a larger French force drove them off. The French builtFort Duquesnebased on LaSalle\\'s 1669 claims. TheFrench and Indian War, the North American front of theSeven Years\\' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British GeneralEdward Braddockwas dispatched with MajorGeorge Washingtonas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[28]The British and colonial force were defeated atBraddock\\'s Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction onFort Pitt, named afterWilliam Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[29]', \"DuringPontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribeslaid siege to Fort Pittin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after ColonelHenry Bouquetdefeated a portion of the besieging force at theBattle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[30][31][32][33]\", 'During this period, the powerful nations of theIroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768Treaty of Fort Stanwix, thePennswere allowed to purchase the modern region from theIroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[34]Both theColony of Virginiaand theProvince of Pennsylvaniaclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend theMason–Dixon linewestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,Bedford County, Pennsylvaniawas created to govern the frontier.', \"On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created asPitt Township.[35][36]William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[37]\", 'Following theAmerican Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of theOhio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, thePittsburgh Post-Gazettewas started, and in 1787, thePittsburgh Academywas chartered. Unrest during theWhiskey Rebellionof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing theAppalachian Mountainsor through theGreat Lakes.Fort Pitt(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into theNorthwest Territory.', '19th century', 'The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for theLewis and Clark Expedition.[38]Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 whenMeriwether Lewispurchased akeelboatthat would later be used to ascend theMissouri River.[39]', 'TheWar of 1812cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.', \"In the 1830s, manyWelsh peoplefrom theMerthyrsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of theMerthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of theAllegheny Mountains. TheGreat Fire of Pittsburghdestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape theGreat Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\\xa0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming fromGermany.\", \"Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city.

Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.[145]', 'Economy', 'Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

      "{'content': ['', 'The Pittsburgh Press, formerlyThe Pittsburg Pressand originallyThe Evening Penny Press, was a major afternoon daily newspaper published inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania for over a century, from 1884 to 1992. At the height of its popularity, thePresswas the second-largest newspaper inPennsylvaniabehindThe Philadelphia Inquirer. For four years starting in 2011, the brand was revived and applied to an afternoononline editionof thePittsburgh Post-Gazette.', 'History', '19th century', \"The history of thePresstraces back to an effort by Thomas J. Keenan Jr. to buyThe Pittsburg Timesnewspaper, at which he was employed as city editor. Joining Keenan in his endeavor were reporter John S. Ritenour of thePittsburgh Post, Charles W. Houston of the city clerk's office, and U.S. RepresentativeThomas M. Bayne.[1]\", 'After examining theTimesand finding it in a poor state, the group changed course and decided to start a newpenny paperin hopes that it would flourish in a local market full of two- and three-cent dailies.[2]The first issue appeared on June 23, 1884.[3]', 'A corporation was formed, with Bayne as the largest shareholder.[1]Initially calledThe Evening Penny Press, the newspaper\\'s name changed toThe Pittsburg Presson October 19, 1887.[4][5]The paper referred to thecity as \"Pittsburg\"until August 1921, when the letter \\'h\\' was added.[6]', '20th century', 'In 1901, Keenan, who had by then gained financial and editorial control of the paper, sold out to a syndicate led by Oliver S. Hershman.[7][8]Hershman remained the controlling owner until selling to theScripps-Howardchain in 1923.[9]', \"In 1961, thePressentered into aJoint Operating Agreement(JOA) with the competingPittsburgh Post-Gazette. ThePost-Gazettehad previously purchased and merged with theHearst Corporation'sPittsburgh Sun-Telegraphleaving just itself and the much largerPittsburgh Press. The agreement was to be managed by the owners of thePittsburgh Press,E. W. Scripps Company, since thePresshad the larger circulation and brand identity. Under the agreement, thePost-Gazettebecame a six-day morning paper, and thePittsburgh Pressbecame a six-day afternoon paper in addition to publishing the only Sunday newspaper inPittsburgh.\", 'Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376 (1973), is a 1973 decision of theUnited States Supreme Courtwhich upheld an ordinance enacted inPittsburghthat forbids sex-designatedclassified advertisingfor job opportunities, against a claim by the parent company of thePressthat the ordinance violated its First Amendment rights.', \"On October 22, 1991,Pressmanagement announced significant changes, designed to modernize its distribution system, at the initial bargaining with theTeamstersLocal 211 union, as well as eight other unions. The unions' contracts with thePressexpired on December 31. Negotiations continued into 1992 with no agreement on a new contract. The Teamsters employees finally walked off the job on May 17, effectively putting a halt to the publication of thePressand thePost-Gazette.[10]The Teamsters refused to drive the small delivery trucks more than half full.\", 'In the press room, a union featherbedding provision under which its members had to set up every ad that appeared in the newspaper, even if it ran years before; in the case of advertisements prepared by outside print shops, those ads were still set up in the type used by thePress, and then dismantled. The backlog of such advertisements grew to several years long. With the increasing rise of electronic media, and more younger readers not reading newspapers, the Press could no longer sustain the union practices of the past. The unions would not budge and did not believe that the previous business model could no longer be sustained and afforded. A short sound bite on national TV by the then-mayor supporting the unions was the death knell, and Scripps-Howard consequently ended the newspaper. All the union jobs were lost, as were the jobs of over 100 non-union employees of the newspaper.', 'An attempt by both papers to resume distribution, with replacement drivers, began with the July 27 issues of both papers and lasted two days until they halted publication again due to resistance from the public and civic leaders.[11]The second day, July 28, marked the final edition of thePress.[5]', 'After months of failed negotiations, Scripps put thePittsburgh Pressup for sale on October 2, 1992.Block Communications, the owners of the much smaller JOA paper, thePost-Gazette, agreed to purchase the paper, effective November 30, upon the settlement of the strike.[11]The first issue of the newly combinedPittsburgh Post-Gazette, the first in nearly six months, was published on January 18, 1993, as a single combined newspaper incorporating many features and personnel from thePress, which would no longer be published.[12]The loss of thePittsburgh Presscame as a shock to many Pittsburghers, who expected the larger paper to survive the strike.[citation needed]', 'In return for the sale of thePress, Scripps receivedThe Monterey County Herald. The sale required a ruling by theU.S. Department of Justiceas theNewspaper Preservation Act of 1970regulated the JOA.', '21st century', \"On November 14, 2011, Block Communications announced that it was bringing back thePressin anonline-only edition for the afternoon, effective immediately. David Shribman, the executive editor of thePost-Gazette, explained his paper's motivation for reviving thePressname, citing the fact that his newspaper still receivedletters to the editoraddressed to thePressinstead of thePost-Gazette, and that despite nearly 20 years since its last publication Pittsburgh natives still talked about thePressregularly.\", 'Although published electronically, the newPresswas formatted with a fixed layout replicating that of a traditional printed newspaper, and its font and layout were similar to the original print version of thePress.[13]The experiment ended with the issue of September 25, 2015.[14]', 'See also', 'List of defunct newspapers of the United States', 'Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, current owner of the \"Press\" name and present-day heir to its archives.', 'Pittsburgh Press Co. v.

The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[40]The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[41]Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties.

The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an F to a C grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog.[83]\", 'According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA, from 2021 to 2024, Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time.[84][85]Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they’d seen an “80\\xa0% drop in hazardous air pollutants” and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023.[86]', 'A past 2019 \"State of the Air\" report from theAmerican Lung Association(ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[87]', \"In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, theAmerican Lung Associationranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[88][89]The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel'sClairton Coke Works, the nation's largestcokemill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[90]The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[91]\", 'Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[92]ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It\\'s the best it\\'s been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ...

Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[94]\", \"Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average.[95]The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.[95]Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh.[95]The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities.[95]This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[96]\", 'Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh.[97]WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education.[97]In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[98]', 'Water quality', 'The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[99]This is caused byfrequently overflowing untreated sewageinto local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has acombined sewersystem, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[100]Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[101]As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[102]Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[103]The local sewage authority,Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from theEPAto come up with solutions.[104]In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2\\xa0billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.[105][106]', \"Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority(PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[107]In 2017,Mayor William Pedutoadvocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[108]Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[107]\", \"PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water.[109]Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels.[110]In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties.[111]By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality.[111]Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014,[110]from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection.[112]Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water.[112]\", 'In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water.[112]Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit.[110]In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia.[111]In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[113]Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water.[113]PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[113]', 'There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system.[114]Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[114]Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.[115]', 'Demographics', '2020 census', \"At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.Non-Hispanic whiteswere 64.8% of the population in 2010,[119]compared to 78.7% in 1970.[120]By the2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[118]Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.\", 'Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American.

An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950.[13]Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now.[142]These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.[13]\", 'In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.[143]', 'Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143]', 'The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.[142]Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.[144]Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.[145]', 'Economy', 'Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

       "    'Coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that Wilson is “in consideration” to be the starting quarterback when the Steelers (4-2) host the New York Jets (2-4) on Sunday night. The 35-year-old nine-time Pro Bowler has spent the past six weeks recovering from a calf injury he aggravated a couple of days before the season opener.',\n",
       "    'While Tomlin stressed that Justin Fields \"has been really good\" while filling in for Wilson and the team has “been really good at times,” the NFL\\'s longest-tenured coach added that good was “not to be confused with great.\"',\n",
       "    \"Enter Wilson, who won the starting job at the end of training camp before tweaking the calf less than 72 hours before a Week 1 visit to Atlanta. Tomlin saw enough of Wilson in practice last week to have him serve as the backup behind Fields during a 32-13 win in Las Vegas, and there's a very real chance they could swap roles against the Jets.\",\n",
       "    '“This is a competitive league, man,” Tomlin said. “We’re trying to position ourselves to be that team. And we got a player with talent who hadn’t had an opportunity to play. So we’re going to potentially explore those things.”',\n",
       "    \"Fields has been efficient and occasionally spectacular during his six-week audition. He's also largely avoided the kinds of mistakes that were a common thread during his three years in Chicago, throwing just one interception in 160 attempts. His accuracy, however, had dipped of late. Fields has completed just 57% (29 of 51) of his passes over his past eight quarters, down from 69% (77 of 111) across the opening month of the season.\",\n",
       "    \"The Steelers are also 28th in passing and 20th in scoring, riding a soft(ish) early season schedule and a disruptive defense led by All-Pro linebacker T.J. Watt to a tie atop the AFC North with rival Baltimore. After a pair of home primetime games against the New York City area teams — the Jets on Sunday, the Giants on Oct. 28 — the sledding figures to get far heavier once the calendar flips to November and Wilson's resume may be too tantalizing for Tomlin to pass up.\",\n",
       "    \"Tomlin cautioned that the decision to give Wilson reps with the first team in practice this week has more to do with Wilson's experience and his resume than Fields' performance.\",\n",
       "    '“Justin has been an asset to us,\" Tomlin said.',\n",
       "    \"Just not enough of one for Tomlin to definitively hand the starting job to Fields outright. Tomlin declined to get into specifics on how he will divide the practice snaps with the first team and doesn't expect to make a decision on who will start against the Jets until later in the week.\",\n",
       "    '\"We’re just going to roll the ball out, let both guys work and make decisions from there,\" Tomlin said.',\n",

The movement spread toLübeckand later to associated Hanse towns on the Baltic and North seas, touching even the Christian “colonial” towns east of the Elbe and Saale rivers. In the 13th century the great towns ofBruges,Ghent, andYpres, creditors of the counts ofFlanders, virtually governed the entireprovince. InFrance, revolutionary uprisings, directed against nobility and clergy, sometimes established free communes, but most communities were content with a franchise from their sovereign—despite their limitations compared with the relative liberty of English boroughs after theNorman Conquest. Finally thecorporatefreedom of the towns brought emancipation to individuals. When bishops in the older German cities treated newcomers as serfs, the emperorHenry Vaffirmed the principleStadtluft macht frei(German: “City air brings freedom”) in charters forSpeyerandWorms; such new towns, founded on the lands of lay and clerical lords, offered freedom and land to settlers who took up residence for more than “a year and a day.” In France thevilles neuves(“new towns”) andbastides(medieval French towns laid out on a rectangular grid) likewise conferred rights on servile persons.',\n",
       "     'In the 14th century the growth of urban centres subsided as Europe suffered a series of shocks that includedfaminefrom 1315 to 1317, the emergence of theBlack Death, which spread across Europe starting in 1347, and a period of politicalanarchyand economic decline that continued through the 15th century. Turkish encroachments on the routes to Asia worsened conditions in town and country alike. Europe turned inward upon itself, and, except for a few large centres, activity in the marketplace was depressed. At a time when local specialization and interregional exchange required more-liberal trade policies, craft protectionism and corporate particularism in the cities tended to hobble the course ofeconomic growth. The artisan and labouring classes, moreover, grew strong enough to challenge the oligarchical rule of the wealthy burghers and gentry through disruptions such as theRevolt of the Ciompi(1378), while socialwarfarepeaked in peasant uprisings typified by theJacquerie(1358), but these tended to be short-lived revolts that failed to bring enduringsocial change. The era of decline was relieved, some argue, by the slow process of individual emancipation and the cultural efflorescence of theRenaissance, which effectively grew out of the unique urbanenvironmentof Italy and was strengthened by a high regard for the Classical heritage. These values laid theintellectualbasis for the great age of geographic and scientific discovery exemplified in the new technologies ofgunpowder,mining,printing, andnavigation. Not before the triumph of princely government, in fact, did political allegiance, economic interests, and spiritual authority again become centred in a viable unit of organization, the absolutistnation-state.']},\n",

Through the centralization of power, economy, and belief, it brought order and progress to Europe and provided a framework in which individual energies could once more be channeled to a common end. While the nation stripped the cities of their remainingpretensionsto political and economic independence (heretofore symbolized in their walls andtariffbarriers), it created larger systems of interdependence in which territorialdivision of labourcould operate. National wealth also benefited from the newmercantilistpolicies, but all too often the wealth generated by cities was captured by the state in taxes and then dissipated—either in war or by supporting the splendour of court life and the Baroque glory of palaces and churches. Only in colonial areas, notably the Americas, did the age of expansion see the development of many new cities, and it is significant that the capitals and ports of the colonizing nations experienced their most rapid growth during these years. Under absolutist regimes, however, a few large political and commercial centres grew at the expense of smaller outlying communities and the rural hinterlands.',\n",
       "     'By the 18th century the mercantile classes had grown increasingly disenchanted withmonarchicalrule. Merchants resented their lack of political influence and assuredprestige, and they objected to outmoded regulations that created barriers to commerce—especially those that hindered their efforts to link commercial operations with improved production systems such as factories. Eventually, the merchants would unite with other dissident groups to curb the excesses of absolutism, erase the vestiges of feudalism, and secure a larger voice in the shaping of public policy. In northwestern Europe, where these liberal movements went furthest, the city populations and their influential bourgeois elites played a critical role that was disproportionate to their numbers. Elsewhere, as in Germany, thebourgeoisiewas morereconciledto existing regimes or, as in northern Italy, had assumed a passive if not wholly parasitical role.',\n",

       "   'Background and education': {'content': ['Pitt was born inLondonof a distinguished family. His mother, Lady Harriet Villiers, daughter of Viscount Grandison, belonged to the Anglo-Irish nobility; his father, Robert Pitt, member ofParliament, was the son ofThomas (“Diamond”) Pitt, governor of theEast India Company’s “factory” at Madras (nowChennai), India, where he made a vast fortune and secured one of the world’s largest diamonds (sold in 1717 to the regent of France). “Diamond” Pitt had returned from India with a despotic temper made devilish with spleen and gout; he quarrelled violently with his wife and declared war on “that hellish confusion that is my family,” but he treated his grandson William with affection. Father Robert was mean andcantankerous, and the Villiers blood was notoriously unstable. William inherited thegout, as well as a haughty temper and a strain of manic depression.',\n",
       "     'Such was the background and the smoky, explosiveinheritancethat was suddenly to blaze into genius. But William’s passionate temper and Pitt truculence had to bedisciplined, so he was sent toEton College, where he acquired social polish and learned to be aloof and yet agreeable, to be politelyinsolent. Delicate health and the early onset of gout deprived him of field sports and hunting, but he learned to ride with a good seat and take his port wine, and he enjoyed the select company of clever and well-connected friends—the twoGrenvilles(one to be Earl Temple; the other, George, to be first minister toGeorge III),George Lyttelton,Charles Pratt(to become a follower of Pitt and, as the 1st Earl Camden, a member of his 1766 ministry), and other men who would later become influential in politics, as well asHenry Fielding, author ofTom Jones.But Pitt hated the brutal harshness of Eton and determined to have his own sons educated at home. He continued his education atTrinity College,Oxford, but left after a year without taking a degree. He then spent several months at theUniversity of Utrechtin the Netherlands, probably studying law.',\n",
       "     'Hisclassicaleducation made him think, act, and speak in the grand Roman manner. His favourite poet wasVirgil, and he never forgot the patriotic lessons of Roman history; he constantly readCicero, the golden-tongued orator who couldyetlash offenders with his indignation. Later, in Parliament, his organ-like voice could be distinctly heard outside the House. This voice, perfect timing, and splendid gestures were worthy ofDavid Garrick, the greatest actor of the day and a personal friend; Pitt’s lean, tall, commanding figure, combined with a Roman beaky nose and hawklike eyes—large and gray but turning black when he was roused—overwhelmed all onlookers. To his countrymen he was to become almost a divine portent, a voice from theDelphic oracle.',\n",
       "     'For the present, possessed of a mere £100 a year, he nevertheless rejected the church, a younger son’s last resort as a career. While he was vegetating on a small family property inCornwall, which he called a “cursed hiding-place” in one of his many letters to his adored sister andconfidante, clever Nan (Ann) Pitt, help came from a politically powerful millionaire nobleman, LordCobham, who lived in splendour in a palatial mansion and vast park at Stowe, inBuckinghamshire, to which William and his friends paid visits. Cobham sent William abroad on “The Grand Tour” of Europe (only France and Switzerland were visited, however) and later bought him a cornetcy—a commission—in his ownregimentof horse (1731).']},\n",
       "   'Early political career': {'content': ['In 1735 Pitt was offered one of the“pocket” boroughs his brother controlled,  inWiltshire, and enteredParliament. He belonged to the small group known as “Cobham’s cubs” and the “boy patriots,” the connection of family friends and place hunters whom Cobham was mobilizing to oppose the ministry of SirRobert Walpole(later the 1st earl of Orford). Walpole had governedEnglandsince 1720, monopolizing patronage, and had—they thought—become too ready to compromise in foreign affairs for the sake of peace. The “patriots” joined other discontented Whigs such as John Carteret (later EarlGranville) and William Pulteney (later the 1st earl ofBath) to rally opposition forces behindFrederick Louis,prince of Wales, who was vehemently estranged from his father, KingGeorge II.',\n",
       "     'There were no formal political parties in the 18th century, and political power, together with the financial opportunities it brought, was a gift of patronage from a handful of landowning familyoligarchiesand from the monarch himself; nor was there a formal opposition in Parliament, and opposition to the king’s ministry was regarded as factious and even traitorous. Pitt’s maiden speech in Parliament was so critical of the ministry that it provoked Walpole to deprive him of his military commission, to “muzzle this terrible young cornet of horse.”',\n",
       "     'In 1737 the Prince of Wales made Pitt one of his court officials with a salary of £400 a year. He was still a relatively poor dependent of a powerful Whig clan but already showed an independence of mind and a readiness to appeal topublic opinionoutside Parliament that were new in English political life: when Walpole dismissed him from his cornetcy, he ostentatiously drove about London in a one-horse chaise tounderlinehis poverty. His talents as an orator had already become clear. He repeatedly referred to the “voice of England,” which had to be sought outside Parliament because Parliament was so packed with placemen and sinecurists. He claimed to speak for the commercial interests and even for the colonies overseas, the latter scarcely represented in theCommons. He was using arguments that carried far beyond the close interests of the Whig families; but he made lasting and valuable friendship with the rich sugar planter-aldermen of theCity of Londonin his opposition to Walpole’s cautious handling of thedisputeswith Spain over West Indian trade.',\n",
       "     'Walpole at last fell from power in 1742 and was replaced by a ministry that included his old colleaguesThomas Pelham-Holles, the 1st duke of Newcastle, and Philip Yorke, the 1st earl of Hardwicke, with Carteret as secretary of state. Pulteney was silenced by the grant of a peerage. The “boy patriots,” of whom Pitt was the acknowledged leader, were still excluded. They opposed Carteret even more vigorously than they had Walpole. In theWar of the Austrian Succession(1740–48), Pitt, a former warmonger, now vigorously opposed the sending of men and subsidies to check the French by protectingHanover(the king’s territory in Germany) and condemned Carteret as a “Hanover troop minister”: for this he was never forgiven by hissovereign.',\n",
       "     'Pitt insisted that French power should be opposed at sea and in its colonial possessions, not on the Continent. When Carteret was forced to resign in 1744, Newcastle and his brotherHenry Pelhamtook office and wanted to include Pitt in their ministry, butGeorge IIrefused to accept him, though he did accept Cobham, Lyttelton, and Grenville. It was at this time that Pitt first appeared in Parliament swathed in bandages, on crutches, and with a huge gout boot on his foot, parading his illness. But, in theJacobiterising of 1745 (theForty-five Rebellion), Pitt gained newstatureas the one effective statesman.',\n",
       "     'In February 1746 the king agreed to appoint Pitt joint vice treasurer of Ireland at £3,000 a year, and two months later he became paymaster general of the forces; he bowed very low as he kissed the king’s hands, but George wept with rage. The post of paymaster was one of the most sought after in government, with ample opportunity for corruption. There was an outcry from Pitt’s friends, who suspected he had been bought, but he proceeded to show both hiscontemptfor moneymaking and hisintegrityas an honest but comparatively poor man by ostentatiously refusing to take for himself any more than the official salary of more than £4,000 a year: he put the interest that paymasters before had appropriated to themselves, together with the accounts of the paymaster’s funds, into theBank of Englandand won the people’s hearts again. He introduced many reforms into the administration, and, though he supported the Pelhams’ alliance with Hanover (which was a change of tack), he tried also to strengthen British naval power.',\n",
       "     'Alegacyof £10,000 from the old duchess ofMarlboroughat this time, left to Pitt “for the noble defence he has made for the support of the laws of England, and to prevent the ruin of his country,” enabled him to indulge in more lavish expenditure and generosity. He spent a good deal onlandscape gardeningand bought a new property near London. After a furious quarrel, he became estranged from his sister Nan, who had been his hostess for years.',\n",
       "     'When Henry Pelham died in office in 1754, Pitt hoped for advancement, but, after much reshuffling and intrigue, Newcastle and Henry Fox (later1st Baron Holland) abandoned him for the sake of expediency. He then became ill and retired to a new house atBath, groaning “I wish for nothing but a decent and innocent retreat, not to afford the world the ridiculousspectacleof being passed by every boat that navigates the river.” An invalid and an aging bachelor, he suddenly fell in love with Lady Hester Grenville, became engaged at once, and was married by November 1754. She was 33 and he 46, and she adored him, possibly from the times in her childhood when he had visited Stowe with her brothers. She was attractive, clever, patient, and eminently practical—particularly about money, arranging mortgages, satisfying creditors, and pouring away her own fortune, in his last years of grandiose extravagance, to protect him.',\n",
       "     'It proved to be an ideally happy marriage with a well-ordered, loving home and family (“the infantry” Pitt called them); later he was to be found making hay with them at Hayes Place, his house inKent, going for picnics, and chasing butterflies. He magically became healthy and happy, ready for his last big parliamentary fight for high office. But first, because of his attacks on Newcastle’s ministry, he was dismissed, penniless, from the pay office in 1755. His brother-in-law Earl Temple helped with an annuity of £1,000.']}}},\n",

The furnace charge, or burden, of iron-bearing materials (e.g., iron ore pellets and sinter), coke, and flux (e.g., limestone) descends through the shaft, where it is preheated and reacts with ascending reducing gases to produce liquid iron and slag that accumulate in the hearth. Air that has been preheated to temperatures from 900 to 1,250 °C (1,650 and 2,300 °F), together with injected fuel such asoilornatural gas, is blown into the furnace through multipletuyeres(nozzles) located around the circumference of the furnace near the top of the hearth; these nozzles may number from 12 to as many as 40 on large furnaces. The preheated air is, in turn, supplied from a bustle pipe, a large-diameter pipe encircling the furnace. The preheated air reacts vigorously with the preheated coke, resulting in both the formation of the reducing gas (carbon monoxide) that rises through the furnace and a very high temperature of about 1,650 °C (3,000 °F) that produces the liquid iron and slag.',\n",

Increases in the height of the furnace, coupled with mechanicalbellowsfor introducing greater amounts of air into it, allowed the higher temperatures needed to produce a high-carbon iron known as cast, or pig, iron.

Omitting very extreme cases, iron in itssolid stateis, like all other metals, polycrystalline—that is, it consists of manycrystalsthat join one another on their boundaries. A crystal is a well-ordered arrangement of atoms that can best be pictured as spheres touching one another. They are ordered in planes, called lattices, which penetrate one another in specific ways. For iron, the lattice arrangement can best be visualized by a unit cube with eight iron atoms at its corners. Important for the uniqueness of steel is the allotropy of iron—that is, its existence in two crystalline forms. In thebody-centred cubic(bcc) arrangement, there is an additional iron atom in the centre of each cube. In theface-centred cubic(fcc) arrangement, there is one additional iron atom at the centre of each of the six faces of the unit cube. It is significant that the sides of the face-centred cube, or the distances between neighbouring lattices in the fcc arrangement, are about 25 percent larger than in the bcc arrangement; this means that there is more space in the fcc than in the bcc structure to keep foreign (i.e.,alloying) atoms insolid solution.',\n",

Referred to asferrite, iron in its bcc formation is also calledalpha ironin the lower temperature range anddelta ironin the higher temperature zone. Between 912° and 1,394° C iron is in its fcc order, which is calledausteniteor gamma iron. The allotropic behaviour of iron is retained with few exceptions in steel, even when thealloycontains considerable amounts of other elements.',\n",
       "     'There is also the termbeta iron, which refers not to mechanical properties but rather to the strong magnetic characteristics of iron. Below 770° C (1,420° F), iron is ferromagnetic; the temperature above which it loses this property is often called theCurie point.']},\n",
       "   'Effects ofcarbon': {'content': ['In its pure form, iron is soft and generally not useful as an engineering material; the principal method of strengthening it and converting it into steel is by adding small amounts ofcarbon. In solid steel, carbon is generally found in two forms. Either it is in solid solution in austenite and ferrite or it is found as a carbide. The carbide form can be iron carbide (Fe3C, known ascementite), or it can be a carbide of an alloying element such astitanium. (On the other hand, in gray iron, carbon appears as flakes or clusters ofgraphite, owing to the presence ofsilicon, which suppresses carbide formation.)',\n",
       "     'The effects of carbon are best illustrated by an iron-carbonequilibriumdiagram. The A-B-C line represents the liquidus points (i.e.,the temperatures at which molten iron begins tosolidify), and the H-J-E-C line represents the solidus points (at which solidification is completed). The A-B-C line indicates that solidification temperatures decrease as the carbon content of an iron melt is increased. (This explains why gray iron, which contains more than 2 percent carbon, is processed at much lower temperatures than steel.) Molten steel containing, for example, a carbon content of 0.77 percent (shown by the vertical dashed line in the figure) begins to solidify at about 1,475° C (2,660° F) and is completely solid at about 1,400° C (2,550° F). From this point down, the iron crystals are all in an austenitic—i.e.,fcc—arrangement and contain all of the carbon in solid solution. Cooling further, a dramatic change takes place at about 727° C (1,341° F) when the austenite crystals transform into a fine lamellar structure consisting of alternating platelets of ferrite and iron carbide. This microstructure is calledpearlite, and the change is called theeutectoidic transformation. Pearlite has adiamond pyramid hardness (DPH) of approximately 200 kilograms-force per square millimetre (285,000 pounds per square inch), compared with a DPH of 70 kilograms-force per square millimetre for pure iron. Cooling steel with a lower carbon content (e.g.,0.25 percent) results in a microstructure containing about 50 percent pearlite and 50 percent ferrite; this is softer than pearlite, with a DPH of about 130. Steel with more than 0.77 percent carbon—for instance, 1.05 percent—contains in its microstructure pearlite and cementite; it is harder than pearlite and may have a DPH of 250.']}}},\n",

Between 1815 and 1861 the economy of the Northern states was rapidly modernizing and diversifying. Although agriculture—mostly smaller farms that relied on free labour—remained the dominant sector in the North, industrialization had taken root there. Moreover, Northerners had invested heavily in an expansive and varied transportation system that included canals, roads, steamboats, and railroads; in financial industries such as banking and insurance; and in a large communications network that featured inexpensive, widely available newspapers, magazines, and books, along with the telegraph.',\n",
       "     'By contrast, the Southern economy was based principally on large farms (plantations) that produced commercial crops such ascottonand that relied on slaves as the mainlabour force. Rather thaninvestin factories or railroads as Northerners had done, Southerners invested their money in slaves—even more than in land; by 1860, 84 percent of the capital invested in manufacturing was invested in the free (nonslaveholding) states. Yet, to Southerners, as late as 1860, this appeared to be a sound business decision. The price of cotton, the South’s defining crop, had skyrocketed in the 1850s, and the value of slaves—who were, after all, property—rose commensurately. By 1860 the per capita wealth of Southern whites was twice that of Northerners, and three-fifths of the wealthiest individuals in the country were Southerners.',\n",

When the slave territory ofMissourisought statehood in 1818, Congress debated for two years before arriving upon theMissouri Compromiseof 1820. This was the first of a series of political deals that resulted from arguments between pro-slavery and antislavery forces over the expansion of the “peculiar institution,” as it was known, into the West. The end of theMexican-American Warin 1848 and the roughly 500,000 square miles (1.3 million square km) of new territory that the United States gained as a result of it added a new sense of urgency to the dispute. More and more Northerners, driven by a sense ofmoralityor an interest in protecting free labour, came to believe, in the 1850s, that bondage needed to beeradicated. White Southerners feared that limiting the expansion of slavery would consign the institution to certain death. Over the course of the decade, the two sides became increasingly polarized and politicians less able to contain the dispute through compromise. WhenAbraham Lincoln, the candidate of the explicitly antislaveryRepublican Party, won the1860 presidential election, seven Southern states (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas) carried out their threat and seceded, organizing as theConfederate States of America.',\n",

Poverty is said to exist when people lack the means to satisfy their basic needs. In thiscontext, the identification of poor people first requires a determination of whatconstitutesbasic needs. These may be defined as narrowly as “those necessary for survival” or as broadly as “those reflecting the prevailingstandard of livingin the community.” The firstcriterionwould cover only those people near the borderline of starvation or death from exposure; the second would extend to people whose nutrition, housing, and clothing, though adequate to preserve life, do not measure up to those of the population as a whole. The problem of definition is furthercompoundedby the noneconomicconnotationsthat the word poverty has acquired. Poverty has been associated, for example, with poor health, low levels ofeducationor skills, an inability or an unwillingness to work, high rates of disruptive or disorderly behaviour, and improvidence. While these attributes have often been found to exist with poverty, their inclusion in a definition of poverty would tend to obscure the relation between them and the inability to provide for one’s basic needs. Whatever definition one uses, authorities and laypersons alike commonly assume that the effects of poverty are harmful to both individuals and society.',\n",

TheUnited States’experience in theGreat Depressionof the 1930s, though unique in some of its features, exemplifies this kind of poverty. And until the Great Depression, poverty resulting from business fluctuations was accepted as an inevitable consequence of a natural process of marketregulation.Reliefwas granted to theunemployedto tide them over until the business cycle again entered an upswing. The experiences of the Great Depression inspired a generation of economists such asJohn Maynard Keynes, who sought solutions to the problems caused by extreme swings in the business cycle. Since the Great Depression, governments in nearly all advanced industrial societies have adopted economic policies that attempt to limit the ill effects of economic fluctuation. In this sense, governments play an activerolein poverty alleviation by increasing spending as a means ofstimulatingthe economy. Part of this spending comes in the form of direct assistance to the unemployed, either throughunemployment compensation, welfare, and other subsidies or by employment on public-works projects.

This increasedpopulation growthstems primarily from loweredinfant mortality ratesmade possible by improved sanitary and disease-control measures. Unless such lowered rates eventually result in women bearing fewer children, the result is a sharp acceleration in population growth. To reduce birth rates, some developing countries have undertaken nationally administered family-planning programs, with varying results. Many developing nations are also characterized by a long-standing system of unequaldistribution of wealth—a system likely to continue despite marked increases in the GNP. Some authorities have observed the tendency for a large portion of any increase to be siphoned off by persons who are already wealthy, while others claim that increases in GNP will always trickle down to the part of the population living at the subsistence level.']},\n",

       "     'It was nationalisticsentimentthat helped to make baseball “America’s game.” In the quest to obtain greater culturalautonomy, Americans yearned for a sport they could claim as exclusively their own. Just as the English hadcricketand the Germans theirturnvereins (gymnastic clubs), a sporting newspaper declared as early as 1857 that Americans should have a “game that could be termed a ‘Native American Sport.’ ” A powerful confirmation of baseball as the sport to fill that need came in 1907 when a special commission appointed byA.G. Spalding, a sporting goods magnate who had formerly been a star pitcher and an executive with a baseball team, reported that baseball owed absolutely nothing to England and thechildren’s gameofrounders. Instead, the commission claimed that, to the best of its knowledge (a knowledge based on flimsy research and self-serving logic), baseball had been invented byAbner DoubledayatCooperstown,New York, in 1839. This originmythwas perpetuated for decades.',\n",
       "     'In a countrycomprisinga multiplicity of ethnic and religious groups, one without a monarchy, anaristocracy, or a long and mythic past, the experience of playing, watching, and talking about baseball games became one of the nation’s great common denominators. It provided, in the perceptive words of British novelistVirginia Woolf, “a centre, a meeting place for the divers activities of a people whom a vast continent isolates [and] whom no tradition controls.” No matter where one lived, the “hit-and-run,” the “double play,” and the “sacrifice bunt” were carried out the same way. The unifying power of baseball in the United States was evident in the Depression-ravaged 1930s, when a group of Cooperstown’s businessmen along with officials from the major leagues established theNational Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The Hall of Fame became a quasi-religious shrine for many Americans, and, since its founding, millions of fans have made “pilgrimages” to Cooperstown, where they have observed the “relics”—old bats, balls, and uniforms—of bygone heroes.',\n",
       "     'Baseball also reshaped the nation’s calendar. With the rise of industrialization, the standardized clock time of the office or factory robbed people of the earlier experience of time in its rich associations with the daylight hours, the natural rhythms of the seasons, and the traditional church calendar.Yet, for Americans, the opening of the baseball training season signaled the arrival of spring, regular-season play meant summer, and the World Series marked the arrival of fall. In the winter, baseball fans participated in “hot stove leagues,” reminiscing about past games and greats and speculating about what the next season had to offer.',\n",

The series was, saidEverybody’s Magazinein 1911, “the veryquintessenceand consummation of the Most Perfect Thing in America.” Each fall it absorbed the entire nation.',\n",
       "     'Baseball terms and phrases, such as “He threw me a curve,” “Her presentation covered all the bases,” and “He’s really out in left field,” soon became part of the national vocabulary, so entrenched is baseball in the ordinary conversation of Americans. During the administration of PresidentGeorge H.W. Bush, a baseball player during his years atYale University, the foreign press struggled to translate the president’s routine use of baseballmetaphors. As early as the 1850s, baseball images began to appear in periodicals, and, in the 20th century, popular illustratorNorman Rockwelloften used baseball as the subject for hisThe Saturday Evening Postcovers. “Casey at the Bat” and “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” remain among the best-known poems and songs, respectively, among Americans. Novelists and filmmakers frequently have turned to baseball motifs. After the mid-20th century, at the very time baseball at the grassroots level had begun a perceptible descent, baseball fiction proliferated. American colleges and universities even began to offer courses on baseball literature, and baseball films likewise proliferated. In 1994 the Public Broadcasting System releasedKen Burns’snostalgicBaseball, arguably the most monumental historical television documentary ever made.',\n",
       "     'While baseball possessed enormous integrative powers, the game’s history also has been interwoven with and reflective of major social and cultural cleavages. Until the first decades of the 20th century, middle-class Evangelical Protestants viewed the sport with profound suspicion. They associated baseball, or at least the professional version of the game, with ne’er-do-wells, immigrants, the working class, drinking, gambling, and general rowdiness. Conversely, these very qualities provided a foothold for the upward ascent of ethnic groups from the nation’s ghettos. Usually encountering lessdiscriminationin baseball (as well as in othervenuesof commercial entertainment) than they did in the more “respectable” occupations, in the 19th century Irish and German Americans were soconspicuousin professional baseball that some observers wondered if they had a special capacity for playing the game.',\n",
       "     'For a brief time in the 1880s, beforeracial segregationbecame the norm in the United States,Blackplayers competed with whites in professional baseball. After that period, however, Blacks had to carve out a separate world of baseball. Dozens of Black teams faced local semiprofessional teams while barnstorming throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Despite playing a high quality of baseball, the players frequently engaged in various forms of clowning that perpetuated prevailingstereotypesof Blacks to appeal to spectators. From the 1920s until the ’50s, separate Black professional leagues—theNegro leagues—existed as well, but in 1947Jackie Robinsoncrossed the long-standing colour bar inmajor league baseball. Because baseball was the national game, its racialintegrationwas of enormous symbolic importance in the United States; indeed, it preceded the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision ending racial segregation in the schools (in 1954 inBrownv.Board of Education of Topeka) and helped to usher in thecivil rights movementof the 1950s and ’60s. Moreover, in the 1980s and ’90s a huge influx of Hispanics into professional baseball reflected the country’s changing ethniccomposition.',\n",
       "     'Baseball likewise contributed to the shaping of Americanconceptionsof gender roles. Althoughwomenwere playing baseball as early as the 1860s, their involvement in the sport was confined for the most part to the role of spectator. To counter the game’s reputation for rowdiness, baseball promoters took pains to encourage women to attend. “The presence of an assemblage of ladies purifies themoralatmosphere of a baseball gathering,” reported theBaseball Chronicle, “repressing as it does, all the out-burst of intemperate language which the excitement of a contest so frequently induces.” When women played on barnstorming teams in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, the press routinely referred to them as “Amazons,” “freaks,” or “frauds.” In 1943, duringWorld War II, when it was feared that professional baseball might be forced to close down, theAll-American Girls Professional Baseball Leaguemade its debut. After having provided more than 600 women an opportunity to play baseball and to entertain several million fans, the league folded in 1954.',\n",
       "     'But, even if unable to heal conflicts arising from fundamental social divisions, baseball exhibited an extraordinarycapacityfor fostering ties. In the 1850s, young artisans and clerks, frequently displaced in the city and finding their way of life changing rapidly in the midst of theIndustrial Revolution, conceived of themselves as members of what was known as the “base ball fraternity.” Like the volunteer fire departments and militia units of the day, they donned special uniforms, developed their own rituals, and, in playing baseball, shared powerful common experiences. Playing and watching baseball contests also strengthened occupational, ethnic, and racial identities. Butchers, typesetters, draymen, bricklayers, and even clergymen organized baseball clubs. So did Irish Americans, German Americans, and African Americans.',\n",
       "     'Professional baseball nourished and deepened urban identities. “If we are ahead of the big city [New York] in nothing else,” crowed theBrooklyn Eagleas early as 1862, “we can beat her in baseball.” Fans invested their emotions in their professional representative nines. “A deep gloom settled over the city,” reported a Chicago newspaper in 1875 after the local White Stockings had been defeated by the St. Louis (Missouri) Brown Stockings. “Friends refused to recognize friends, lovers became estranged, and business was suspended.” Even in the late 20th century, in an age more given tocynicism, the successes and failures of professional teams continued to evoke strong feelings among local residents. For example, during the 1990s, after having experienced urban decay and demoralization in the previous two decades,Clevelandexperienced a great civic revival fueled in part by the success of the Indians baseball team.',\n",
       "     'The significance of specific baseball teams and individual players extended beyond the localities that they represented. TheNew York Yankees, who in the first half of the 20th century were the quintessential representatives of the big city, of the East, of urban America with its sophistication, and of ethnic and religious heterogeneity, became synonymous with supernal success, while theSt. Louis Cardinalsemerged as the quintessential champions of the Midwest, of small towns and the farms, of rural America with its simplicity, rusticity, and old-stock Protestanthomogeneity. In the 1920sBabe Ruthbecame the diamond’s colossal demigod. To those toiling on assembly lines or sitting at their desks in corporatebureaucracies, Ruth embodied America’s continuing faith in upwardsocial mobility. His mighty home runs furnished vivid proof that men remained masters of their own destinies and that they could still rise from mean, vulgar beginnings to fame and fortune. For African Americans, Black stars such asSatchel PaigeandJosh Gibsonfurnished equally compelling models of individual inspiration and success.',\n",
       "     'Baseball parksbecame important local civic monuments and repositories ofcollectivememories. The first parks had been jerry-built, flimsy wooden structures, but between 1909 and 1923 some 15 major league clubs constructed new, more permanent parks of steel and concrete. These edifices were akin to the great public buildings, skyscrapers, and railway terminals of the day; local residents proudly pointed to them as evidence of their city’s size and its achievements.',\n",
       "     'Seeing them as retreats from the noise, dirt, and squalor of the industrial city, the owners gave the first parks pastoral names—Ebbets Field, Sportsman’s Park, and the Polo Grounds—but, with the construction of symmetrical, multisports facilities in the 1960s and ’70s, urban and futuristic names such asAstrodomeand Kingdome predominated. In a new park-building era in the 1990s, designers sought to recapture theambienceof earlier times by designing “retro parks,” a term that was something of anoxymoronin that, while the new parks offered the fan the intimacy of the old-time parks, they simultaneously provided modern conveniences such as escalators, climate-controlled lounges, high-tech audiovisual systems, Disneyesque play areas for children, and space for numerous retail outlets. The increasing corporate influence on the game was reflected in park names such as Network Associates Stadium andBank OneBallpark.',\n",
       "     'After about the mid-20th century, baseball’s claim to being America’s game rested on more precarious foundations than in the past. The sport facedpotentcompetition, not only from other professional sports (especially gridiron football) but even more from a massive conversion of Americans from public to private, at-home diversions. Attendance as a percentage of population fell at all levels of baseball, the minor leagues became a shell of their former selves, and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams folded. In the 1990s, player strikes, free agency, disparities in competition, and the rising cost of attending games added to the woes of major league baseball. Yet, baseball continued to exhibit a remarkable resiliency; attendance at professional games improved, and attendance at minor league games was close to World War II records by the end of the century. As the 21st century opened, baseball still faced serious problems, but the sport was gaining in popularity around the world, and a strong case could still be made for baseball holding a special place in the hearts and minds of the American people.']}}},\n",

This soccer-style game became the dominant form as Columbia, Cornell,Yale, and a few other colleges in the Northeast took up the sport in the early 1870s, and in 1873 representatives from Princeton, Yale, and Rutgers met inNew York Cityto found the Intercollegiate Football Association and to adopt a common code.

In May 1874, in the second of two matches withMcGill Universityof Montreal (the first was played by the rules of the Boston Game), Harvard’s players were introduced to the rugby game and immediately preferred it to their own. The following year, for Harvard’s first football contest with Yale, representatives of the two schools agreed on “concessionary rules” that were chiefly Harvard’s.

Rejecting the traditional manner of putting the ball in play—players from both teams massed about the ball in a “scrummage,” or “scrum,” trying to kick it forward through the mass of players—Harvard opted for “heeling it out,” or kicking the ball backward to a teammate. The further transformation of English rugby into American football came chiefly through the efforts ofWalter Camp, who even during his lifetime was known as the “Father of American Football.” As an undergraduate and then a medical student at Yale, Camp played football from 1876 through 1881, but—more important—beginning in 1878, he dominated the rules committee for nearly three crucial decades. Two of Camp’s revisions in particular effectively created the gridiron game. The first, in 1880, further refined Harvard’s initialinnovation, abolishing the scrummage altogether in favor of ascrimmage, which awarded possession of the ball to one of the two teams. It was then put in play by heeling it out. (Snapping the ball with the hand became legal in 1890, though snapping with the foot continued as an option until 1913.)',\n",

After Princeton simply held the ball for an entire half in its 1880 and 1881 contests with Yale, both games ending in scoreless ties thatboredspectators as much as they frustrated Yale’s players, Camp proposed a rule that a team must advance the ball 5 yards or lose 10 in threedowns (plays), or it would be obliged to surrender the ball to the other side. Camp was also responsible for having 11 players on a side, for devising a new scoring system in 1883 with two points for atouchdown, four points for the goal after a touchdown, and five points for afield goal (a field goal became worth three points in 1909, a touchdown six points in 1912), for creating the quarterback position, for marking the field with stripes, and for proposing several otherinnovations, but it was those two simple rules adopted in 1880 and 1882 that most fundamentally created American football.',\n",
       "     'After the crucial rule changes, the play of the game was relatively open, featuring long runs and numerous lateral passes, as in rugby. In 1888 Camp proposed that tackling below the waist be legalized, in order to offset the advantage of speedy backs streaking around the ends. The new rule resulted in the rise of mass plays, an offensive strategy that massed players on a single point of the defense, most famously in Harvard’s “flying wedge” in 1892. This style of play proved so brutal that the game was nearlyabolishedin the 1890s and early 1900s.']}}},\n",

However, the team failed to advance past theconferencefinals over that span, losing to a lower-seeded team in five of the six postseasons. The team broke through in 2015–16, ending the regular season on a hot streak that carried over into the postseason, during which the Penguins captured another Stanley Cup title (over theSan Jose Sharksin six games). The Penguins tallied the second most points in the NHL (111) in 2016–17, and in the postseason the team won seven-game series in both the second round and Eastern Conference finals to return to the Stanley Cup finals, where they faced theNashville Predators.

It was probably fundamentally this game that spread throughout Canada via Scottish and Irish immigrants and the British army. The players adopted elements of field hockey, such as the “bully” (later the face-off) and “shinning” (hitting one’s opponent on the shins with the stick or playing with the stick on one “shin” or side); this evolved into an informal ice game later known asshinnyor shinty. The namehockey—as the organized game came to be known—has beenattributedto the French wordhoquet(shepherd’s stick). The termrink, referring to the designated area of play, was originally used in the game ofcurlingin 18th-century Scotland. Early hockey games allowed as many as 30 players a side on the ice, and the goals were two stones, each frozen into one end of the ice. The first use of a puck instead of a ball was recorded at Kingston Harbour, Ontario, Canada, in 1860.']},\n",

Unfortunately, the reputation for violence that the game would later develop was presaged in this earlyencounter, where, asThe Daily British WhigofKingston, Ontario, reported, “Shins and heads were battered, benches smashed and the lady spectators fled in confusion.” The first organized team, theMcGill University Hockey Club, formed in 1877, codified their game’s rules and limited the number of players on a side to nine.',\n",
       "     'By the late 1800s ice hockey competed with lacrosse as Canada’s most popular sport. The first national hockey organization, theAmateur Hockey Association (AHA) of Canada (which limited players to seven a side), was formed inMontrealin 1885, and the first league was formed in Kingston during the same year, with four teams: the Kingston Hockey Club,Queen’s University, the Kingston Athletics, and the Royal Military College. Queen’s University scored a 3–1 victory over the Athletics in the first championship game.',\n",
       "     'By the opening of the 20th century, sticks were being manufactured, shin pads were worn, the goaltender began to wear a chest protector (borrowed from baseball), and arenas (still with natural ice and no heat for spectators) were being constructed throughout eastern Canada. In 1893 national attention was focused on the game when the Canadian governor-general,Frederick Arthur, Lord Stanley of Preston, donated a cup to be given annually to the top Canadian team. The three-foot-high silver cup became known as theStanley Cupand was first awarded in 1892–93. (The first winner was theMontreal Amateur Athletic Association team, which also captured the Stanley Cup the following season by winning the initial challenge series to determine the Cup holder, which was the Cup-awarding format that Lord Stanley originally intended.) Since 1926 the cup has gone to the winner of theNational Hockey Leagueplay-offs.',\n",
       "     'In 1899 theCanadian Amateur Hockey League was formed. All hockey in Canada at the time was “amateur,” it being “ungentlemanly” to admit to being paid for athletic services. Thus, the first acknowledged professional hockey team in the world was formed in theUnited States, in 1903, in Houghton, Michigan. The team, thePortage Lakers, was owned by a dentist namedJ.L. Gibson, who imported Canadian players. In 1904 Gibson formed the first acknowledged professional league, theInternational Pro Hockey League.

Rising interest in the game created problems, however, for there were few artificial-ice rinks.

Although the NHA ultimately emerged as the stronger league, it was the PCHA that introduced many of the changes that improved the game. The only radical rule change adopted by the NHA was to reduce the number of players on a side to six, and that move was made to save money. The western league retained seven-man hockey, but it allowed the goalie to leap ordiveto stop the puck. Under the previous rules, a goalie had had to remain stationary when making a save. The western league also changed the offside rule. Under the old rules, a player had been deemed offside if he was ahead of the puck carrier when he received a pass. The PCHA divided the ice into three zones by painting two blue lines across the surface and allowed forward passing in the centre zone between the blue lines. This opened up the game and made it more exciting. Anotherinnovationin the western league was the idea of the assist. Previously, only the goal scorer had been credited with a point. In the PCHA the player or players who set up his goal were credited with an assist. The first numbered uniforms also appeared in their league.']}}}}"

       "    'Since then, three foundations have worked diligently to return industrial vitality to the site. The Heinz Endowments, Richard King Mellon Foundation and Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation joined forces in 2002 to purchase the property and have led efforts to clean the brownfield site and seek new development opportunities.',\n",
       "    'Rebranding the property as Hazelwood Green in October, the foundations brought the Hazelwood community, along with local, state and federal government stakeholders together to realize a vision for the property that will create opportunity, while promoting diversity and economic sustainability.',\n",

       "    \"A key component of the Hazelwood Green effort will be to make the development a center for workforce training and education to empower American workers to be more competitive in the global manufacturing marketplace. The effort also aims to further Pittsburgh's resurgence as a global innovation leader.\",\n",

It\\'s about building a new part of the campus in a new direction, both physically and metaphorically,\" said CMU President Subra Suresh. \"The Tepper Quad will embody a distinctive academic vision of Carnegie Mellon … different disciplines coming together in new and unique ways.\"', 'Alumnus and investor David Tepper (TPR 1982), whose charitable foundation provided a lead gift of $67 million, said that the project is about the next generation of education.', '\"That vision of education on the college and graduate school level is to bring all the schools together and have them interact,\" Tepper said. \"This is Carnegie Mellon not just talking the talk — we\\'re going to walk the walk.\"', \"The Tepper Quad's first major building will have 305,000 square feet housing theTepper School of Business; theSwartz Center for Entrepreneurship; technology-enhanced learning initiatives, includingThe Simon Initiative; state-of-the-art classrooms; and a new university welcome center.\", 'The facility also will offer many quality-of-life enhancements for the campus community, including meeting and collaboration spaces, a 600-seat auditorium, fitness center and dining facilities.', 'Kera Bartlett, a second-year MBA student and president of the Graduate Business Association, also spoke during the event. She said that as prospective students look at the future of the Tepper School of Business, this innovative model of collaborative, interdisciplinary education is compelling.', '\"We\\'re sharing our excitement,\" she said. \"We\\'re sharing our passion about this long-term opportunity for the university as well as the immediate benefits that they will experience. It\\'s such an incredible step forward.\"', 'The national financial network CNBC set up an anchor desk on campus and aired live interviews and taped segments from CMU throughout the day, including clips of the groundbreaking event.

      "{'New Building, New Vision': {'Tepper School To Move Front and Center': {'content': ['ByBruce Gerson', 'Exciting. Cool. Interconnected. Entrepreneurial. Engaging. And how about, amazing!', 'Those were just some of the words used to describe designs for the new home of the Tepper School of Business, the first project slated for theTepper Quadon the Morewood parking lot site.', 'Beautiful computer-generated renderings for the 295,000 square-foot, five-story marvel with underground parking — yes, parking for 200 — were recently unveiled by the project team, including Tepper School Dean Robert Dammon, faculty rep Bryan Routledge, architect Buzz Yudell, Associate Vice Provost forCampus Design and Facility DevelopmentRalph Horgan, and Director of Design Bob Reppe.', 'But, before the stunning images were revealed, Dammon reflected on the significance and impact the new building and location will have for the business school.', '“It’s much more than a building, it’s a new vision for the business school of the future,” said Dammon, who noted that business schools are usually built on the edge of campus to keep their students focused on strictly business.', '“We want to create an environment that will bring all of campus together so we can collaborate on problems that really matter to the world,” he said. “We have great strengths across campus and we want to be connected to that as a business school.”', 'Dammon said the b-school also must be a better asset to the campus.', '“We’re moving from the edge [of campus] to the center, not just physically, but intellectually as well,” he said.', 'Yudell called the project, which aims to set the stage for future campus growth to the north, an extraordinary opportunity. Yudell is a principal of Moore Ruble Yudell Architects and Planners of Santa Monica, Calif.“As a design team, there’s nothing more exciting than to make a physical place that supports, enhances and nurtures the ongoing vision and mission for the school and the university. We’re designing for today, and 10, 20 years from now,” he said.', 'Yudell outlined several key principles the team used to shape their work. Among them were creating a hub for campus; enlivening campus life with mixed uses; energizing collaboration and innovation; creating domains for undergraduate and graduate students; and integrating technology to support the delivery of curricula.', 'He said this “Tepper School Plus” would be welcoming, “green,” flexible, adaptable and sustainable, providing diverse, rich, multi-program experiences with many choices. He said it would be grand and intimate, lively and quiet, public and private.', '“A rich ecology is one that is diverse and changing,” he said.', 'The attractive sculptured exterior of the building will consist of the Hornbostel cream-colored brick and glass with porches and bays.', '“We wanted to use the original palette and push it forward,” Yudell said of the yellow brick. “We can use the prevailing materials in a new way to connect to the history and still push it forward.”', 'He said by using the architectural history of the university, the building speaks to visitors, in a way, telling them that they’re in a beautiful setting and entering into the CMU district.', 'Interior spaces will be flooded with natural light, warm fabric furnishings and wood to promote collaboration and interaction. Yudell said the inside would be lively, even the stairways. He called the wide ergonomically sound stairways, “social stairs” that encourage people to be active.', '“Sitting is the new smoking,” he said.', 'The ground floor and first level off of Forbes Avenue will include an 18-foot high atrium inside the front door, a 600-seat auditorium that can be reconfigured into different sizes, a Technology-Enhanced Learning Center, a fitness center with locker rooms and showers, and a welcome center.', 'The second floor, accessible from the entrance facing the Cut, will include several dining options, such as grab & go and various cooking stations.', '“Food is central to the life of a building,” Yudell said.', 'Levels two and three will contain 18 classrooms and flexible academic support spaces, an undergraduate and graduate student commons area, breakout rooms and collaborative areas, and an Entrepreneurship Center. Classrooms will be equipped with technology for production and linking to CMU campuses around the globe.', 'The fourth and fifth floors will be used for faculty, Ph.D. and staff offices and meeting space. Yudell said there would be a “faculty neighborhood” instead of a faculty lounge.', '“Faculty have given up having a faculty lounge in favor of having spaces between offices to become part of a mixing bowl to generate interaction and make it a unique place,” he said.', 'Dammon said the space would draw the campus community in.', '“We hope people come over to collaborate on research and education, for social reasons, to eat, to workout. We want them to come and never leave,”he said.', 'Designs for the new Tepper School of Business, the first building in the Tepper Quad, were unveiled at a Town Hall meeting.

Around 50 cases had also been confirmed in other countries, in Asia, the United States and Europe.</p>, <p>\n",

      "</aside></p>, <p>Researchers fear similarities to the 2002–03 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in southern China and killed 774 people in 37 countries. Both are members of a large virus family, called coronaviruses, that also includes viruses responsible for the common cold.</p>, <p>China has taken unprecedented action to try to halt the outbreak — including putting Wuhan and nearby cities on ‘lockdown’, restricting travel in and out of the cities. For now, the World Health Organization (WHO) has held off declaring a public-health emergency of international concern — the agency’s highest level of alarm — after a meeting of officials last week, but that could change.</p>, <p><i>Nature</i> rounds up the questions at the heart of scientists’ efforts to understand the virus.</p>, <p>This is the most urgent question surrounding the outbreak. Chinese authorities have confirmed that it spreads from person to person after identifying clusters of cases among families, as well as transmission from patients to health-care workers. Monitoring the rate at which new cases appear, and when symptoms began for each case, should reveal how easily the virus passes between humans and whether the outbreak has the potential to persist.</p>, <p>One figure that epidemiologists want is the number of people that someone with the virus tends to infect — known as <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>. An <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> of more than 1 means that countermeasures, such as quarantine, will be needed to contain the spread. The WHO last week published an estimated <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> of 1.4–2.5. Other teams suggest slightly higher values<sup><a data-action=\"anchor-link\" data-track=\"click\" data-track-category=\"references\" data-track-label=\"go to reference\" href=\"#ref-CR1\">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a data-action=\"anchor-link\" data-track=\"click\" data-track-category=\"references\" data-track-label=\"go to reference\" href=\"#ref-CR2\">2</a></sup>. These estimates are similar to the <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> of SARS during the early stages of the 2002–03 outbreak, and of the novel strain of H1N1 influenza that caused a pandemic in 2009. But they are higher than <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> values estimated during outbreaks of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, a coronavirus similar to SARS.</p>, <p>“Now it’s in the range of these other important epidemics, and that indicates the potential that it will cause a similar scale of public-health concern if nothing else happens,” says Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.</p>, <p>But researchers caution that <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> estimates come with large uncertainties because of gaps in the data, and the assumptions used to calculate the figure. They also point out that the <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is a moving target and that estimates of the figure change over the course of an outbreak — as control measures are implemented. In the coming days, health authorities and researchers will be looking for signs that the travel restrictions in Wuhan and other Chinese cities, and other steps taken by to stem transmission, have reduced the <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> there.</p>, <p>Another major unanswered question is whether — and how extensively — people without symptoms can infect others. A study<sup><a data-action=\"anchor-link\" data-track=\"click\" data-track-category=\"references\" data-track-label=\"go to reference\" href=\"#ref-CR3\">3</a></sup> of a cluster of six infections in a family in Shenzhen identified a child who was infected with the virus but showed no symptoms. If such asymptomatic cases are common and these individuals can spread the virus, then containing its spread will be much more difficult, researchers say. Key to controlling the SARS virus was the fact that few cases were asymptomatic.</p>, <p>“Defining the scale of asymptomatic transmission remains key: if this is a rare event then its impact should be minimal in terms of the overall outbreak,” Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, UK, said in a statement distributed by the UK Science Media Centre. “But, if this transmission mode is contributing significantly then control becomes increasingly difficult.”</p>, <p>\n",

      "</aside></p>, <p>One way to determine whether symptom-free people can spread the virus would be to study its spread in individual households in China, says Sheila Bird, a biostatistician at the University of Cambridge, UK. By monitoring all the members of a household in which one person is infected, it should be possible to determine who else contracts the virus and how. Such studies would also be helpful for identifying ways of stopping spread in households, Bird adds.</p>, <p>Raina MacIntyre, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that although the rise in cases probably reflects an increase in testing for and detecting the virus, the dramatic jump is concerning. “It’s very much a dynamic picture, and until we have an indication that cases are declining, it’s going to continue to be of concern,” she says.</p>, <p>But MacIntyre also notes that researchers are struggling to accurately model the outbreak, and to predict how it might unfold, because the case-report data being released by Chinese authorities are incomplete. “What we need to identify is when people got sick, not when the cases were reported, and all we’ve seen so far is when the cases were reported.”</p>, <p>High rates of pneumonia among the first people infected had many researchers worried that the Wuhan virus was especially pernicious. Those concerns have receded slightly, as more mild cases have turned up. With some 100 deaths in more than 4,500 reported cases, the virus does not seem to be as deadly as SARS — which killed around 10% of the people it infected. But “It’s too early to be sanguine about the severity”, says Neil Ferguson, a mathematical epidemiologist at Imperial College London.</p>, <p>Authorities are working on the theory that the virus originated in an unidentified animal or animals, and spread to humans at an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, which is now closed. Identification of the animal source of the virus could help officials to control the current outbreak and gauge its threat — and potentially prevent future epidemics, say researchers.</p>, <p>Genetic sequencing suggests that the Wuhan virus is related to <a data-label=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07766-9\" data-track=\"click\" data-track-category=\"body text link\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20210308142952/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07766-9\">coronaviruses that circulate in bats</a>, including SARS and its close relatives. But other mammals can transmit these viruses — SARS was probably spread to humans by civet cats.</p>, <p>\n",

      "</aside></p>, <p>The market in Wuhan also sells wild animals. And in a controversial study<sup><a data-action=\"anchor-link\" data-track=\"click\" data-track-category=\"references\" data-track-label=\"go to reference\" href=\"#ref-CR4\">4</a></sup> published last week, a team of researchers in China who had performed a genetic analysis suggested that the virus jumped to humans from snakes. But other scientists were sceptical of the study, and said that there is no proof that viruses such as those behind the outbreak can infect species other than mammals and birds. “Nothing supports snakes being involved,” says David Robertson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow, UK.</p>, <p>Many researchers think that the animal host or hosts of the virus won’t be identified without further field and laboratory work. And many hope that genetic tests of animals or environmental sources will turn up clues.</p>, <p>A mammal is the most likely candidate, says Cui Jie, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute of Shanghai who was part of a team that identified SARS-related viruses in bats from a cave in Yunnan province in southwestern China in 2017. SARS and the new virus are part of a subgroup known as betacoronaviruses. Fieldwork in the wake of the SARS outbreak has found such viruses only in mammals, Cui says.</p>, <p>Genetic sequencing of the Wuhan coronavirus offers clues to its origins and spread. Labs in China and Thailand have sequenced the genomes of more than 20 strains found in infected people and have made them publicly available. That’s “pretty remarkable”, says Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary geneticist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, who is <a data-label=\"https://nextstrain.org/ncov\" data-track=\"click\" data-track-category=\"body text link\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20210308142952/https://nextstrain.org/ncov\">analysing the sequences as they come in</a>. “People are extremely fast and excellent about data sharing,” he adds.</p>, <p>Bedford and other geneticists are using the data to determine when the virus emerged — current estimates point to November 2019. Viral sequences, Bedford adds, could identify any genetic changes that might have helped the virus make the jump from animals to humans. And if there is extensive human-to-human transmission, Bedford and other geneticists will be looking for signs that the virus has gained further mutations that are enabling it to spread more efficiently in humans.</p>, <p>Bedford cautions that any conclusions are preliminary, because so few data are available. “Adding a few key samples can change the story significantly,” he says.</p>, <p>No drugs have been shown to be effective in treating SARS or other coronavirus infections in humans, and no vaccines aimed at preventing these infections have been licensed.</p>, <p>A team at China’s National Engineering Research Center for the Emergence Drugs in Beijing is working on finding therapies that would work by blocking the receptor on human cells that the virus latches on to and uses to infect the cells. A <a data-label=\"http://engine.scichina.com/publisher/scp/journal/SCLS/doi/10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5?slug=fulltext\" data-track=\"click\" data-track-category=\"body text link\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20210308142952/http://engine.scichina.com/publisher/scp/journal/SCLS/doi/10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5?slug=fulltext\">comparison of the SARS and new China virus sequences</a>, published on 16 January, found that they probably bind to the same receptor. The team is hoping to revive efforts to develop treatments for SARS and adapt them in a bid to develop a drug that could work against the latest virus.</p>, <p>Another researcher who has been developing drugs for coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak is hoping to <a data-label=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00190-6\" data-track=\"click\" data-track-category=\"body text link\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20210308142952/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00190-6\">test drug candidates in animal models of the Wuhan virus</a>.</p>, <p>Chinese authorities are also testing whether existing HIV drugs can treat the infection. Ritonavir and liponavir, which are approved to treat HIV, are being given to people with pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, according to media reports and a 26 January statement by the Beijing branch of China’s National Health Commission.</p>]\n"
