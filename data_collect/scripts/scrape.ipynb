Wheels, to be used efficiently, required roads, and thus came roadbuilding, an art most highly developed in ancient times by the Romans.

Throughout western Europe, towns acquired various kinds of municipal institutions loosely grouped under thedesignationcommune. Broadly speaking, the history of the medieval towns is that of the rising merchant classes seeking to free their communities from lordly jurisdiction and to secure their government to themselves. Wherevermonarchicalpower was strong, the merchants had to be content with a municipal status, but elsewhere they created city-states. Taking advantage of renewed conflict between popes and emperors, they allied with local nobility to establish communal self-government in the largest cities ofLombardy,Tuscany, andLiguria. InGermanythe city councils sometimes usurped the rights of higher clergy and nobility;Freiburg im Breisgauobtained itsexemplarycharter of liberties in 1120. The movement spread toLübeckand later to associated Hanse towns on the Baltic and North seas, touching even the Christian “colonial” towns east of the Elbe and Saale rivers. In the 13th century the great towns ofBruges,Ghent, andYpres, creditors of the counts ofFlanders, virtually governed the entireprovince. InFrance, revolutionary uprisings, directed against nobility and clergy, sometimes established free communes, but most communities were content with a franchise from their sovereign—despite their limitations compared with the relative liberty of English boroughs after theNorman Conquest. Finally thecorporatefreedom of the towns brought emancipation to individuals. When bishops in the older German cities treated newcomers as serfs, the emperorHenry Vaffirmed the principleStadtluft macht frei(German: “City air brings freedom”) in charters forSpeyerandWorms; such new towns, founded on the lands of lay and clerical lords, offered freedom and land to settlers who took up residence for more than “a year and a day.” In France thevilles neuves(“new towns”) andbastides(medieval French towns laid out on a rectangular grid) likewise conferred rights on servile persons.',\n",

Turkish encroachments on the routes to Asia worsened conditions in town and country alike. Europe turned inward upon itself, and, except for a few large centres, activity in the marketplace was depressed. At a time when local specialization and interregional exchange required more-liberal trade policies, craft protectionism and corporate particularism in the cities tended to hobble the course ofeconomic growth.

The era of decline was relieved, some argue, by the slow process of individual emancipation and the cultural efflorescence of theRenaissance, which effectively grew out of the unique urbanenvironmentof Italy and was strengthened by a high regard for the Classical heritage. These values laid theintellectualbasis for the great age of geographic and scientific discovery exemplified in the new technologies ofgunpowder,mining,printing, andnavigation.

While the nation stripped the cities of their remainingpretensionsto political and economic independence (heretofore symbolized in their walls andtariffbarriers), it created larger systems of interdependence in which territorialdivision of labourcould operate. National wealth also benefited from the newmercantilistpolicies, but all too often the wealth generated by cities was captured by the state in taxes and then dissipated—either in war or by supporting the splendour of court life and the Baroque glory of palaces and churches. Only in colonial areas, notably the Americas, did the age of expansion see the development of many new cities, and it is significant that the capitals and ports of the colonizing nations experienced their most rapid growth during these years.

Father Robert was mean andcantankerous, and the Villiers blood was notoriously unstable. William inherited thegout, as well as a haughty temper and a strain of manic depression.',\n",

Delicate health and the early onset of gout deprived him of field sports and hunting, but he learned to ride with a good seat and take his port wine, and he enjoyed the select company of clever and well-connected friends—the twoGrenvilles(one to be Earl Temple; the other, George, to be first minister toGeorge III),George Lyttelton,Charles Pratt(to become a follower of Pitt and, as the 1st Earl Camden, a member of his 1766 ministry), and other men who would later become influential in politics, as well asHenry Fielding, author ofTom Jones.But Pitt hated the brutal harshness of Eton and determined to have his own sons educated at home.

He then spent several months at theUniversity of Utrechtin the Netherlands, probably studying law.',\n",

Later, in Parliament, his organ-like voice could be distinctly heard outside the House. This voice, perfect timing, and splendid gestures were worthy ofDavid Garrick, the greatest actor of the day and a personal friend; Pitt’s lean, tall, commanding figure, combined with a Roman beaky nose and hawklike eyes—large and gray but turning black when he was roused—overwhelmed all onlookers.

Walpole had governedEnglandsince 1720, monopolizing patronage, and had—they thought—become too ready to compromise in foreign affairs for the sake of peace. The “patriots” joined other discontented Whigs such as John Carteret (later EarlGranville) and William Pulteney (later the 1st earl ofBath) to rally opposition forces behindFrederick Louis,prince of Wales, who was vehemently estranged from his father, KingGeorge II.',\n",
       "     'There were no formal political parties in the 18th century, and political power, together with the financial opportunities it brought, was a gift of patronage from a handful of landowning familyoligarchiesand from the monarch himself; nor was there a formal opposition in Parliament, and opposition to the king’s ministry was regarded as factious and even traitorous. Pitt’s maiden speech in Parliament was so critical of the ministry that it provoked Walpole to deprive him of his military commission, to “muzzle this terrible young cornet of horse.”',\n",
       "     'In 1737 the Prince of Wales made Pitt one of his court officials with a salary of £400 a year. He was still a relatively poor dependent of a powerful Whig clan but already showed an independence of mind and a readiness to appeal topublic opinionoutside Parliament that were new in English political life: when Walpole dismissed him from his cornetcy, he ostentatiously drove about London in a one-horse chaise tounderlinehis poverty. His talents as an orator had already become clear. He repeatedly referred to the “voice of England,” which had to be sought outside Parliament because Parliament was so packed with placemen and sinecurists. He claimed to speak for the commercial interests and even for the colonies overseas, the latter scarcely represented in theCommons. He was using arguments that carried far beyond the close interests of the Whig families; but he made lasting and valuable friendship with the rich sugar planter-aldermen of theCity of Londonin his opposition to Walpole’s cautious handling of thedisputeswith Spain over West Indian trade.',\n",

Pulteney was silenced by the grant of a peerage. The “boy patriots,” of whom Pitt was the acknowledged leader, were still excluded. They opposed Carteret even more vigorously than they had Walpole. In theWar of the Austrian Succession(1740–48), Pitt, a former warmonger, now vigorously opposed the sending of men and subsidies to check the French by protectingHanover(the king’s territory in Germany) and condemned Carteret as a “Hanover troop minister”: for this he was never forgiven by hissovereign.',\n",

The post of paymaster was one of the most sought after in government, with ample opportunity for corruption. There was an outcry from Pitt’s friends, who suspected he had been bought, but he proceeded to show both hiscontemptfor moneymaking and hisintegrityas an honest but comparatively poor man by ostentatiously refusing to take for himself any more than the official salary of more than £4,000 a year: he put the interest that paymasters before had appropriated to themselves, together with the accounts of the paymaster’s funds, into theBank of Englandand won the people’s hearts again. He introduced many reforms into the administration, and, though he supported the Pelhams’ alliance with Hanover (which was a change of tack), he tried also to strengthen British naval power.',\n",

       "     'When Henry Pelham died in office in 1754, Pitt hoped for advancement, but, after much reshuffling and intrigue, Newcastle and Henry Fox (later1st Baron Holland) abandoned him for the sake of expediency. He then became ill and retired to a new house atBath, groaning “I wish for nothing but a decent and innocent retreat, not to afford the world the ridiculousspectacleof being passed by every boat that navigates the river.” An invalid and an aging bachelor, he suddenly fell in love with Lady Hester Grenville, became engaged at once, and was married by November 1754.

The war was therefore one fought by small field armies. Militias, poorlydisciplinedand with elected officers, were summoned for periods usually not exceeding three months. The terms of Continental Army service were only gradually increased from one to three years, and not even bounties and the offer of land kept the army up to strength. Reasons for the difficulty in maintaining an adequate Continental force included the colonists’ traditionalantipathytoward regular armies, the objections of farmers to being away from their fields, the competition of the states with theContinental Congressto keep men in themilitia, and the wretched and uncertain pay in a period ofinflation.',\n",

The furnace charge, or burden, of iron-bearing materials (e.g., iron ore pellets and sinter), coke, and flux (e.g., limestone) descends through the shaft, where it is preheated and reacts with ascending reducing gases to produce liquid iron and slag that accumulate in the hearth. Air that has been preheated to temperatures from 900 to 1,250 °C (1,650 and 2,300 °F), together with injected fuel such asoilornatural gas, is blown into the furnace through multipletuyeres(nozzles) located around the circumference of the furnace near the top of the hearth; these nozzles may number from 12 to as many as 40 on large furnaces. The preheated air is, in turn, supplied from a bustle pipe, a large-diameter pipe encircling the furnace. The preheated air reacts vigorously with the preheated coke, resulting in both the formation of the reducing gas (carbon monoxide) that rises through the furnace and a very high temperature of about 1,650 °C (3,000 °F) that produces the liquid iron and slag.',\n",

Increases in the height of the furnace, coupled with mechanicalbellowsfor introducing greater amounts of air into it, allowed the higher temperatures needed to produce a high-carbon iron known as cast, or pig, iron.

Omitting very extreme cases, iron in itssolid stateis, like all other metals, polycrystalline—that is, it consists of manycrystalsthat join one another on their boundaries. A crystal is a well-ordered arrangement of atoms that can best be pictured as spheres touching one another. They are ordered in planes, called lattices, which penetrate one another in specific ways. For iron, the lattice arrangement can best be visualized by a unit cube with eight iron atoms at its corners. Important for the uniqueness of steel is the allotropy of iron—that is, its existence in two crystalline forms. In thebody-centred cubic(bcc) arrangement, there is an additional iron atom in the centre of each cube. In theface-centred cubic(fcc) arrangement, there is one additional iron atom at the centre of each of the six faces of the unit cube. It is significant that the sides of the face-centred cube, or the distances between neighbouring lattices in the fcc arrangement, are about 25 percent larger than in the bcc arrangement; this means that there is more space in the fcc than in the bcc structure to keep foreign (i.e.,alloying) atoms insolid solution.',\n",

Referred to asferrite, iron in its bcc formation is also calledalpha ironin the lower temperature range anddelta ironin the higher temperature zone. Between 912° and 1,394° C iron is in its fcc order, which is calledausteniteor gamma iron. The allotropic behaviour of iron is retained with few exceptions in steel, even when thealloycontains considerable amounts of other elements.',\n",
       "     'There is also the termbeta iron, which refers not to mechanical properties but rather to the strong magnetic characteristics of iron. Below 770° C (1,420° F), iron is ferromagnetic; the temperature above which it loses this property is often called theCurie point.']},\n",
       "   'Effects ofcarbon': {'content': ['In its pure form, iron is soft and generally not useful as an engineering material; the principal method of strengthening it and converting it into steel is by adding small amounts ofcarbon. In solid steel, carbon is generally found in two forms. Either it is in solid solution in austenite and ferrite or it is found as a carbide. The carbide form can be iron carbide (Fe3C, known ascementite), or it can be a carbide of an alloying element such astitanium. (On the other hand, in gray iron, carbon appears as flakes or clusters ofgraphite, owing to the presence ofsilicon, which suppresses carbide formation.)',\n",
       "     'The effects of carbon are best illustrated by an iron-carbonequilibriumdiagram. The A-B-C line represents the liquidus points (i.e.,the temperatures at which molten iron begins tosolidify), and the H-J-E-C line represents the solidus points (at which solidification is completed). The A-B-C line indicates that solidification temperatures decrease as the carbon content of an iron melt is increased. (This explains why gray iron, which contains more than 2 percent carbon, is processed at much lower temperatures than steel.) Molten steel containing, for example, a carbon content of 0.77 percent (shown by the vertical dashed line in the figure) begins to solidify at about 1,475° C (2,660° F) and is completely solid at about 1,400° C (2,550° F). From this point down, the iron crystals are all in an austenitic—i.e.,fcc—arrangement and contain all of the carbon in solid solution. Cooling further, a dramatic change takes place at about 727° C (1,341° F) when the austenite crystals transform into a fine lamellar structure consisting of alternating platelets of ferrite and iron carbide. This microstructure is calledpearlite, and the change is called theeutectoidic transformation. Pearlite has adiamond pyramid hardness (DPH) of approximately 200 kilograms-force per square millimetre (285,000 pounds per square inch), compared with a DPH of 70 kilograms-force per square millimetre for pure iron. Cooling steel with a lower carbon content (e.g.,0.25 percent) results in a microstructure containing about 50 percent pearlite and 50 percent ferrite; this is softer than pearlite, with a DPH of about 130. Steel with more than 0.77 percent carbon—for instance, 1.05 percent—contains in its microstructure pearlite and cementite; it is harder than pearlite and may have a DPH of 250.']}}},\n",

Between 1815 and 1861 the economy of the Northern states was rapidly modernizing and diversifying. Although agriculture—mostly smaller farms that relied on free labour—remained the dominant sector in the North, industrialization had taken root there. Moreover, Northerners had invested heavily in an expansive and varied transportation system that included canals, roads, steamboats, and railroads; in financial industries such as banking and insurance; and in a large communications network that featured inexpensive, widely available newspapers, magazines, and books, along with the telegraph.',\n",

This was the first of a series of political deals that resulted from arguments between pro-slavery and antislavery forces over the expansion of the “peculiar institution,” as it was known, into the West. The end of theMexican-American Warin 1848 and the roughly 500,000 square miles (1.3 million square km) of new territory that the United States gained as a result of it added a new sense of urgency to the dispute.

       "    'poverty,  the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions. Poverty is said to exist when people lack the means to satisfy their basic needs. In thiscontext, the identification of poor people first requires a determination of whatconstitutesbasic needs. These may be defined as narrowly as “those necessary for survival” or as broadly as “those reflecting the prevailingstandard of livingin the community.” The firstcriterionwould cover only those people near the borderline of starvation or death from exposure; the second would extend to people whose nutrition, housing, and clothing, though adequate to preserve life, do not measure up to those of the population as a whole. The problem of definition is furthercompoundedby the noneconomicconnotationsthat the word poverty has acquired. Poverty has been associated, for example, with poor health, low levels ofeducationor skills, an inability or an unwillingness to work, high rates of disruptive or disorderly behaviour, and improvidence. While these attributes have often been found to exist with poverty, their inclusion in a definition of poverty would tend to obscure the relation between them and the inability to provide for one’s basic needs. Whatever definition one uses, authorities and laypersons alike commonly assume that the effects of poverty are harmful to both individuals and society.',\n",
       "    'Although poverty is a phenomenon as old ashumanhistory, its significance has changed over time. Under traditional (i.e., nonindustrialized) modes of economic production,widespreadpoverty had been accepted as inevitable. The total output of goods and services, even if equally distributed, would still have been insufficient to give the entirepopulationa comfortable standard of living by prevailing standards. With the economic productivity that resulted fromindustrialization, however, this ceased to be the case—especially in the world’s mostindustrialized countries, where national outputs were sufficient to raise the entire population to a comfortable level if the necessary redistribution could be arranged without adversely affecting output.',\n",
       "    'Several types of poverty may be distinguished depending on such factors as time or duration (long- or short-term or cyclical) and distribution (widespread, concentrated, individual).',\n",

In nonindustrial societies (present and past), this sort of inability to provide for one’s basic needs rests mainly upon temporary food shortages caused by natural phenomena or poor agricultural planning. Prices would rise because of scarcities of food, which brought widespread,albeittemporary, misery.',\n",
       "     'In industrialized societies the chief cyclical cause of poverty is fluctuations in thebusiness cycle, with mass unemployment during periods ofdepressionor seriousrecession. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the industrialized nations of the world experienced business panics and recessions that temporarily enlarged the numbers of the poor. TheUnited States’experience in theGreat Depressionof the 1930s, though unique in some of its features, exemplifies this kind of poverty. And until the Great Depression, poverty resulting from business fluctuations was accepted as an inevitable consequence of a natural process of marketregulation.Reliefwas granted to theunemployedto tide them over until the business cycle again entered an upswing. The experiences of the Great Depression inspired a generation of economists such asJohn Maynard Keynes, who sought solutions to the problems caused by extreme swings in the business cycle. Since the Great Depression, governments in nearly all advanced industrial societies have adopted economic policies that attempt to limit the ill effects of economic fluctuation. In this sense, governments play an activerolein poverty alleviation by increasing spending as a means ofstimulatingthe economy. Part of this spending comes in the form of direct assistance to the unemployed, either throughunemployment compensation, welfare, and other subsidies or by employment on public-works projects. Although business depressions affect all segments of society, the impact is most severe on people of the lowest socioeconomic strata because they have fewer marginal resources than those of a higher strata.']},\n",

Both generalized and concentrated collective poverty may be transmitted from generation to generation, parents passing their poverty on to their children.',\n",

Lowlife expectancy, high levels of infant mortality, and poor health characterize life in these societies.',\n",
       "     'Collective poverty is usually related to economic underdevelopment. The total resources of manydeveloping nationsin Africa, Asia, and South and Central America would be insufficient to support the population adequately even if they were equally divided among all of the citizens. Proposed remedies are twofold: (1) expansion of thegross national product(GNP) through improved agriculture or industrialization, or both, and (2) population limitation. Thus far, both population control andinducedeconomic development in many countries have proved difficult, controversial, and at times inconclusive or disappointing in their results.',\n",
       "     'An increase of the GNP does not necessarily lead to an improved standard of living for the population at large, for a number of reasons. The most important reason is that, in many developing countries, the population grows even faster than the economy does, with no net reduction in poverty as a result. This increasedpopulation growthstems primarily from loweredinfant mortality ratesmade possible by improved sanitary and disease-control measures. Unless such lowered rates eventually result in women bearing fewer children, the result is a sharp acceleration in population growth. To reduce birth rates, some developing countries have undertaken nationally administered family-planning programs, with varying results. Many developing nations are also characterized by a long-standing system of unequaldistribution of wealth—a system likely to continue despite marked increases in the GNP. Some authorities have observed the tendency for a large portion of any increase to be siphoned off by persons who are already wealthy, while others claim that increases in GNP will always trickle down to the part of the population living at the subsistence level.']},\n",

These people, like those afflicted with generalized poverty, have higher mortality rates, poor health, low educational levels, and so forth when compared with the more affluent segments of society. Their chief economic traits are unemployment and underemployment, unskilled occupations, and job instability.

       "     'In a countrycomprisinga multiplicity of ethnic and religious groups, one without a monarchy, anaristocracy, or a long and mythic past, the experience of playing, watching, and talking about baseball games became one of the nation’s great common denominators. It provided, in the perceptive words of British novelistVirginia Woolf, “a centre, a meeting place for the divers activities of a people whom a vast continent isolates [and] whom no tradition controls.” No matter where one lived, the “hit-and-run,” the “double play,” and the “sacrifice bunt” were carried out the same way. The unifying power of baseball in the United States was evident in the Depression-ravaged 1930s, when a group of Cooperstown’s businessmen along with officials from the major leagues established theNational Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The Hall of Fame became a quasi-religious shrine for many Americans, and, since its founding, millions of fans have made “pilgrimages” to Cooperstown, where they have observed the “relics”—old bats, balls, and uniforms—of bygone heroes.',\n",
       "     'Baseball also reshaped the nation’s calendar. With the rise of industrialization, the standardized clock time of the office or factory robbed people of the earlier experience of time in its rich associations with the daylight hours, the natural rhythms of the seasons, and the traditional church calendar.Yet, for Americans, the opening of the baseball training season signaled the arrival of spring, regular-season play meant summer, and the World Series marked the arrival of fall. In the winter, baseball fans participated in “hot stove leagues,” reminiscing about past games and greats and speculating about what the next season had to offer.',\n",
       "     'TheWorld Series, inaugurated in 1903 and pitting the champions of the American and National Leagues in a postseason play-off, quickly took its place alongside theFourth of Julyand Christmas as one of the most popular annual rites. The series was, saidEverybody’s Magazinein 1911, “the veryquintessenceand consummation of the Most Perfect Thing in America.” Each fall it absorbed the entire nation.',\n",
       "     'Baseball terms and phrases, such as “He threw me a curve,” “Her presentation covered all the bases,” and “He’s really out in left field,” soon became part of the national vocabulary, so entrenched is baseball in the ordinary conversation of Americans. During the administration of PresidentGeorge H.W. Bush, a baseball player during his years atYale University, the foreign press struggled to translate the president’s routine use of baseballmetaphors. As early as the 1850s, baseball images began to appear in periodicals, and, in the 20th century, popular illustratorNorman Rockwelloften used baseball as the subject for hisThe Saturday Evening Postcovers. “Casey at the Bat” and “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” remain among the best-known poems and songs, respectively, among Americans. Novelists and filmmakers frequently have turned to baseball motifs. After the mid-20th century, at the very time baseball at the grassroots level had begun a perceptible descent, baseball fiction proliferated. American colleges and universities even began to offer courses on baseball literature, and baseball films likewise proliferated. In 1994 the Public Broadcasting System releasedKen Burns’snostalgicBaseball, arguably the most monumental historical television documentary ever made.',\n",
       "     'While baseball possessed enormous integrative powers, the game’s history also has been interwoven with and reflective of major social and cultural cleavages. Until the first decades of the 20th century, middle-class Evangelical Protestants viewed the sport with profound suspicion. They associated baseball, or at least the professional version of the game, with ne’er-do-wells, immigrants, the working class, drinking, gambling, and general rowdiness. Conversely, these very qualities provided a foothold for the upward ascent of ethnic groups from the nation’s ghettos. Usually encountering lessdiscriminationin baseball (as well as in othervenuesof commercial entertainment) than they did in the more “respectable” occupations, in the 19th century Irish and German Americans were soconspicuousin professional baseball that some observers wondered if they had a special capacity for playing the game.',\n",
       "     'For a brief time in the 1880s, beforeracial segregationbecame the norm in the United States,Blackplayers competed with whites in professional baseball. After that period, however, Blacks had to carve out a separate world of baseball. Dozens of Black teams faced local semiprofessional teams while barnstorming throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Despite playing a high quality of baseball, the players frequently engaged in various forms of clowning that perpetuated prevailingstereotypesof Blacks to appeal to spectators. From the 1920s until the ’50s, separate Black professional leagues—theNegro leagues—existed as well, but in 1947Jackie Robinsoncrossed the long-standing colour bar inmajor league baseball. Because baseball was the national game, its racialintegrationwas of enormous symbolic importance in the United States; indeed, it preceded the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision ending racial segregation in the schools (in 1954 inBrownv.Board of Education of Topeka) and helped to usher in thecivil rights movementof the 1950s and ’60s. Moreover, in the 1980s and ’90s a huge influx of Hispanics into professional baseball reflected the country’s changing ethniccomposition.',\n",
       "     'Baseball likewise contributed to the shaping of Americanconceptionsof gender roles. Althoughwomenwere playing baseball as early as the 1860s, their involvement in the sport was confined for the most part to the role of spectator. To counter the game’s reputation for rowdiness, baseball promoters took pains to encourage women to attend. “The presence of an assemblage of ladies purifies themoralatmosphere of a baseball gathering,” reported theBaseball Chronicle, “repressing as it does, all the out-burst of intemperate language which the excitement of a contest so frequently induces.” When women played on barnstorming teams in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, the press routinely referred to them as “Amazons,” “freaks,” or “frauds.” In 1943, duringWorld War II, when it was feared that professional baseball might be forced to close down, theAll-American Girls Professional Baseball Leaguemade its debut. After having provided more than 600 women an opportunity to play baseball and to entertain several million fans, the league folded in 1954.',\n",
       "     'But, even if unable to heal conflicts arising from fundamental social divisions, baseball exhibited an extraordinarycapacityfor fostering ties. In the 1850s, young artisans and clerks, frequently displaced in the city and finding their way of life changing rapidly in the midst of theIndustrial Revolution, conceived of themselves as members of what was known as the “base ball fraternity.” Like the volunteer fire departments and militia units of the day, they donned special uniforms, developed their own rituals, and, in playing baseball, shared powerful common experiences. Playing and watching baseball contests also strengthened occupational, ethnic, and racial identities. Butchers, typesetters, draymen, bricklayers, and even clergymen organized baseball clubs. So did Irish Americans, German Americans, and African Americans.',\n",
       "     'Professional baseball nourished and deepened urban identities. “If we are ahead of the big city [New York] in nothing else,” crowed theBrooklyn Eagleas early as 1862, “we can beat her in baseball.” Fans invested their emotions in their professional representative nines. “A deep gloom settled over the city,” reported a Chicago newspaper in 1875 after the local White Stockings had been defeated by the St. Louis (Missouri) Brown Stockings. “Friends refused to recognize friends, lovers became estranged, and business was suspended.” Even in the late 20th century, in an age more given tocynicism, the successes and failures of professional teams continued to evoke strong feelings among local residents. For example, during the 1990s, after having experienced urban decay and demoralization in the previous two decades,Clevelandexperienced a great civic revival fueled in part by the success of the Indians baseball team.',\n",
       "     'The significance of specific baseball teams and individual players extended beyond the localities that they represented. TheNew York Yankees, who in the first half of the 20th century were the quintessential representatives of the big city, of the East, of urban America with its sophistication, and of ethnic and religious heterogeneity, became synonymous with supernal success, while theSt. Louis Cardinalsemerged as the quintessential champions of the Midwest, of small towns and the farms, of rural America with its simplicity, rusticity, and old-stock Protestanthomogeneity. In the 1920sBabe Ruthbecame the diamond’s colossal demigod. To those toiling on assembly lines or sitting at their desks in corporatebureaucracies, Ruth embodied America’s continuing faith in upwardsocial mobility. His mighty home runs furnished vivid proof that men remained masters of their own destinies and that they could still rise from mean, vulgar beginnings to fame and fortune. For African Americans, Black stars such asSatchel PaigeandJosh Gibsonfurnished equally compelling models of individual inspiration and success.',\n",
       "     'Baseball parksbecame important local civic monuments and repositories ofcollectivememories. The first parks had been jerry-built, flimsy wooden structures, but between 1909 and 1923 some 15 major league clubs constructed new, more permanent parks of steel and concrete. These edifices were akin to the great public buildings, skyscrapers, and railway terminals of the day; local residents proudly pointed to them as evidence of their city’s size and its achievements.',\n",
       "     'Seeing them as retreats from the noise, dirt, and squalor of the industrial city, the owners gave the first parks pastoral names—Ebbets Field, Sportsman’s Park, and the Polo Grounds—but, with the construction of symmetrical, multisports facilities in the 1960s and ’70s, urban and futuristic names such asAstrodomeand Kingdome predominated. In a new park-building era in the 1990s, designers sought to recapture theambienceof earlier times by designing “retro parks,” a term that was something of anoxymoronin that, while the new parks offered the fan the intimacy of the old-time parks, they simultaneously provided modern conveniences such as escalators, climate-controlled lounges, high-tech audiovisual systems, Disneyesque play areas for children, and space for numerous retail outlets. The increasing corporate influence on the game was reflected in park names such as Network Associates Stadium andBank OneBallpark.',\n",
       "     'After about the mid-20th century, baseball’s claim to being America’s game rested on more precarious foundations than in the past. The sport facedpotentcompetition, not only from other professional sports (especially gridiron football) but even more from a massive conversion of Americans from public to private, at-home diversions. Attendance as a percentage of population fell at all levels of baseball, the minor leagues became a shell of their former selves, and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams folded. In the 1990s, player strikes, free agency, disparities in competition, and the rising cost of attending games added to the woes of major league baseball. Yet, baseball continued to exhibit a remarkable resiliency; attendance at professional games improved, and attendance at minor league games was close to World War II records by the end of the century. As the 21st century opened, baseball still faced serious problems, but the sport was gaining in popularity around the world, and a strong case could still be made for baseball holding a special place in the hearts and minds of the American people.']}}},\n",

After several decades of informal, student-organized games that were tolerated by faculty as analternativeto more destructive rowdiness, the first intercollegiate football game was played on November 6, 1869, inNew Brunswick,New Jersey, between in-state rivalsPrincetonandRutgersaccording to rules adapted from those of the London Football Association. This soccer-style game became the dominant form as Columbia, Cornell,Yale, and a few other colleges in the Northeast took up the sport in the early 1870s, and in 1873 representatives from Princeton, Yale, and Rutgers met inNew York Cityto found the Intercollegiate Football Association and to adopt a common code. Conspicuously missing wasHarvard, the country’s premier university, whose team insisted on playing the so-called “Boston Game,” a cross between soccer and rugby. In May 1874, in the second of two matches withMcGill Universityof Montreal (the first was played by the rules of the Boston Game), Harvard’s players were introduced to the rugby game and immediately preferred it to their own. The following year, for Harvard’s first football contest with Yale, representatives of the two schools agreed on “concessionary rules” that were chiefly Harvard’s. When spectators (including Princeton students) as well as Yale players saw the advantages of the rugby style, the stage was set for a meeting in 1876 of representatives from Harvard, Yale,Princeton, andColumbiato form a newIntercollegiate Football Associationbased on rugby rules.']},\n",

Rejecting the traditional manner of putting the ball in play—players from both teams massed about the ball in a “scrummage,” or “scrum,” trying to kick it forward through the mass of players—Harvard opted for “heeling it out,” or kicking the ball backward to a teammate. The further transformation of English rugby into American football came chiefly through the efforts ofWalter Camp, who even during his lifetime was known as the “Father of American Football.” As an undergraduate and then a medical student at Yale, Camp played football from 1876 through 1881, but—more important—beginning in 1878, he dominated the rules committee for nearly three crucial decades. Two of Camp’s revisions in particular effectively created the gridiron game. The first, in 1880, further refined Harvard’s initialinnovation, abolishing the scrummage altogether in favor of ascrimmage, which awarded possession of the ball to one of the two teams. It was then put in play by heeling it out. (Snapping the ball with the hand became legal in 1890, though snapping with the foot continued as an option until 1913.)',\n",
       "     'The second crucial rule change was necessitated by the first. Camp’s more orderly manner of initiating play did not require the team in possession of the ball to give it up. After Princeton simply held the ball for an entire half in its 1880 and 1881 contests with Yale, both games ending in scoreless ties thatboredspectators as much as they frustrated Yale’s players, Camp proposed a rule that a team must advance the ball 5 yards or lose 10 in threedowns (plays), or it would be obliged to surrender the ball to the other side. Camp was also responsible for having 11 players on a side, for devising a new scoring system in 1883 with two points for atouchdown, four points for the goal after a touchdown, and five points for afield goal (a field goal became worth three points in 1909, a touchdown six points in 1912), for creating the quarterback position, for marking the field with stripes, and for proposing several otherinnovations, but it was those two simple rules adopted in 1880 and 1882 that most fundamentally created American football.',\n",
       "     'After the crucial rule changes, the play of the game was relatively open, featuring long runs and numerous lateral passes, as in rugby. In 1888 Camp proposed that tackling below the waist be legalized, in order to offset the advantage of speedy backs streaking around the ends. The new rule resulted in the rise of mass plays, an offensive strategy that massed players on a single point of the defense, most famously in Harvard’s “flying wedge” in 1892.

Queen’s University scored a 3–1 victory over the Athletics in the first championship game.',\n",
       "     'By the opening of the 20th century, sticks were being manufactured, shin pads were worn, the goaltender began to wear a chest protector (borrowed from baseball), and arenas (still with natural ice and no heat for spectators) were being constructed throughout eastern Canada. In 1893 national attention was focused on the game when the Canadian governor-general,Frederick Arthur, Lord Stanley of Preston, donated a cup to be given annually to the top Canadian team. The three-foot-high silver cup became known as theStanley Cupand was first awarded in 1892–93. (The first winner was theMontreal Amateur Athletic Association team, which also captured the Stanley Cup the following season by winning the initial challenge series to determine the Cup holder, which was the Cup-awarding format that Lord Stanley originally intended.) Since 1926 the cup has gone to the winner of theNational Hockey Leagueplay-offs.',\n",
       "     'In 1899 theCanadian Amateur Hockey League was formed. All hockey in Canada at the time was “amateur,” it being “ungentlemanly” to admit to being paid for athletic services. Thus, the first acknowledged professional hockey team in the world was formed in theUnited States, in 1903, in Houghton, Michigan. The team, thePortage Lakers, was owned by a dentist namedJ.L. Gibson, who imported Canadian players. In 1904 Gibson formed the first acknowledged professional league, theInternational Pro Hockey League. Canada accepted professional hockey in 1908 when theOntario Professional Hockey League was formed. By that time Canada had become the centre of world hockey.']},\n",
       "   'League rivalries': {'content': ['TheNational Hockey Association (NHA), the forerunner of the National Hockey League (NHL), was organized in 1910 and became the strongest hockey association inNorth America. Rising interest in the game created problems, however, for there were few artificial-ice rinks. In 1911 thePacific Coast Hockey Association(PCHA) was formed by Joseph Patrick and his sons, who built two enclosed artificial-ice arenas, beginning a boom in the construction of artificial-ice rinks.',\n",
       "     'The PCHA became involved in a money and player war with the NHA. Although the NHA ultimately emerged as the stronger league, it was the PCHA that introduced many of the changes that improved the game. The only radical rule change adopted by the NHA was to reduce the number of players on a side to six, and that move was made to save money. The western league retained seven-man hockey, but it allowed the goalie to leap ordiveto stop the puck. Under the previous rules, a goalie had had to remain stationary when making a save. The western league also changed the offside rule. Under the old rules, a player had been deemed offside if he was ahead of the puck carrier when he received a pass. The PCHA divided the ice into three zones by painting two blue lines across the surface and allowed forward passing in the centre zone between the blue lines. This opened up the game and made it more exciting. Anotherinnovationin the western league was the idea of the assist. Previously, only the goal scorer had been credited with a point. In the PCHA the player or players who set up his goal were credited with an assist. The first numbered uniforms also appeared in their league.']}}}}"

The bachelor's degree in AI will focus more on how complex inputs, such as vision, language and huge databases, are used to make decisions or enhance human capabilities, he added. AI majors will receive the same solid grounding in computer science and math courses as other computer science students. In addition, they will have additional course work in AI-related subjectsstatistics and probability, computational modeling, machine learning and symbolic computation.\", 'Simmons said the program also would include a strong emphasis on ethics and social responsibility. This will include independent study opportunities in using AI for social good, such as improving transportation, health care or education.', \"Students accepted by SCS as first-year students will be able to enter the AI degree program in their second year. All students thus will be able to take first-year courses in core computer science competencies and introductory courses. This will enable them to make informed choices when it is time to declare a major, whether it's AI,computer scienceorcomputational biology, the latter an undergraduate degree program that began in fall 2017.\", 'Initially, AI undergraduate enrollment will accommodate no more than 100 second-, third- and fourth-year students — or about 30-35 new students each year. SCS enrolls about 735 undergraduates. In fall 2018, a limited number of second- and third-year students who have already taken a substantial number of relevant courses can apply to join the new AI degree program.', \"Just as artificial intelligence unites such disciplines as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics and human-computer interaction, instruction in the AI program will draw on the faculty of SCS'sMachine Learning Department,Language Technologies Institute,Robotics Institute,Human-Computer Interaction Institute,Institute for Software ResearchandComputer Science Department.\", \"The degree will leverage CMU's traditional strength in cross-disciplinary instruction, particularly in exploring the ethical and societal implications of AI, by involving faculty members from theDietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, theHeinz College of Information Systems and Public Policyand theCollege of Engineering.\", 'CMU has a long history in artificial intelligence, including the creation of the first AI computer program in 1956 and pioneering work in self-driving cars, facial recognition and natural language processing. Last year, SCS began its CMU AI research and education initiative, which involves almost 200 faculty members working in AI-related areas that range from art to public policy.', \"CMU also has been a leader in education, offering the first university-level course in computer programming in 1958, launching the first Ph.D. program in robotics and creating the world's first Machine Learning Department. SCS will once again advance computer science education through its AI degree program, said Simmons, who is completing a 2 1/2-year stint as program director in the National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate and lead for the National Robotics Initiative.\", '\"It\\'s an opportunity for us to shape what it means to be a degree program in AI, as opposed to offering courses related to AI,\" Simmons said.
