            "John Forbes was born inDunfermlineon 5 September 1707, youngest child of Colonel John Forbes, 1658–1707, who died several months before his birth, and Elizabeth Graham, daughter of an Edinburgh merchant. His uncle,Duncan Forbes(1644-1704), was a prominent supporter ofWilliam of Orangeand obtained his brother John an army commission.[1]",
            "In 1701, Colonel Forbes purchasedPittencrieff Park, nearDunfermline, and it was here John grew up. He had five elder sisters, of whom little is known, and two older brothers; Arthur (1703-1757), who inherited the estate, and Hugh (1704-1760), who became a lawyer.[2]All three of the Forbes brothers had problems with money; John borrowed large sums to pursue his military career, while Arthur ruined himself expanding Pittencrief, which was sold after his death.[3]",
            "Forbes married Anna Donald and had a daughter Anna."

            "The Forbes family were prominent civic leaders inInverness, who supported the succession ofGeorge Iin 1714 and were political allies of theCampbell Dukes of Argyll. John's cousinDuncan Forbes of Culloden, (1685-1747), becamesenior Scottish legal officerin 1737 and played a key role in suppressing the1745 Jacobite Rising. These personal connections were essential; like many contemporaries, John was also aFreemason, another of the informal networks needed for a successful public career in this period.[4]",
            "Educated locally inDunfermline, Forbes is thought to have studied medicine atEdinburgh University.[5]In September 1729, he was appointed surgeon in theRoyal Scots Greys,[a]then based in Scotland. He remained with the regiment for the next 28 years but gave up his medical post in 1735, when he was commissioned as acornet.[6]",
            "The long period of peace from 1713 to 1739 meant limited opportunities for promotion, while thecommission purchase systemworked against those like Forbes with little money.[b]It was not until April 1742 he was promotedlieutenant, shortly before the regiment was posted to theAustrian Netherlandsto fight in theWar of the Austrian Succession.[7]Forbes becameaide-de-camptoJames Campbell of Lawers, (1690-1745), colonel of the Scots Greys and commander of the Allied cavalry. He fought atDettingenin June 1743 and in September 1744, purchased a commission as captain.[8]",
            "AtFontenoyin May 1745, Campbell sent Forbes with instructions toBrigadier General Ingoldsbyon the Allied right, ordering him to attack a Frenchredoubtwhose fire was impeding their advance. One shot badly wounded Sir James, who was carried from the field; Forbes stayed with him after the Allies retreated and was taken prisoner. He was soon exchanged but Campbell died a few days later and Forbes' letters display genuine grief at his death.[9]",
            "Many viewed Fontenoy as a 'defeat snatched from the jaws of victory', and in the recriminations that followed, Ingoldsby wascourt-martialled. The grounds were his failure to comply with three separate orders to attack the French position, given by Campbell,Cumberland, the Allied commander, andLigonier. Ingoldsby claimed he received conflicting instructions and attempted to blame Forbes, who testified at his trial. While he had some justification, any confusion was caused by Cumberland, not Forbes; in any case, this was not considered an adequate excuse and Ingoldsby was forced to resign.[10]",
            "For reasons that are unclear, unlike many who fought at Fontenoy Forbes did not benefit from Cumberland's patronage, although he was appointed aide to the elderlyEarl of Stair, (1673-1747), Campbell's successor as colonel of the Scots Greys. Some units were sent to Britain in October to put down the 1745 Rising, but not the cavalry, since transporting horses by sea was considered impractical during the winter months. Stair was military commander of Southern Britain and Forbes may have served there for a short period but contrary to legend, he was not present atCulloden.[11]Instead, he returned to Flanders in December 1745 asDeputy Quartermaster-Generaland was a major whenthe war endedin 1748.[12]",
            "Forbes spent the next few years on garrison duty in different parts of Britain and in November 1750, purchased a commission as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Scots Greys.[13]To do so, he borrowed £5,000 but with limited opportunities for further advancement, his debts became an increasingly large problem.[14]"

    "The Forbes Expedition": {
        "content": [
            "TheTreaty of Aix-la-Chapelleset up a commission to resolve territorial disputes between British and French colonies in North America, including theOhio Country,French AcadiaandNova Scotia. Neither side was willing to make concessions, which led to the 1754-1763French and Indian War; in 1755, anexpedition under General Braddockto captureFort Duquesneended in a disastrous defeat.[15]",
            "When the global conflict known as theSeven Years' Warbegan in 1756, James Campbell's nephew, theEarl of Loudoun, was appointedCommander-in-Chief, North Americaand Governor General ofVirginia. In early 1757, Forbes was in Southern England, training a 'light company' of the Scots Greys for attacks on the French coast.[16]In March, he was promoted colonel of the17th Foot, part of a force of 5,400 sent to Novia Scotia for an attempt on Louisbourg.[17]",
            "Following the failure of the1757 Louisbourg Expedition, Forbes was promotedBrigadier generalin December 1757 andgiven command of another attackon Fort Duquesne. His force contained 1,400 regulars, 400 from theRoyal American Regiment, commanded by the experienced Swiss mercenary, Lt-ColonelHenry Bouquet, along with 1,000 Scots who made upMontgomerie's Highlanders. There were also 5,000 provincial militia from Virginia and Pennsylvania, commanded byGeorge Washington, who had carried messages to Fort Le Boeuf in 1753, and accompanied Braddock in 1755.[18]",
            "Forbes decided to build a new road from thePennsylvaniafrontier, since it required fewer river crossings than that used by Braddock, which followed a trail cut in 1752 by the Virginia-basedOhio Company. The decision led to protests from his Virginian officers, many of whom were investors in the company, including two of Washington's brothers.[19]",
            "As a compromise, Forbes agreed to improve Braddock's original road, but use the route through Pennsylvania. A base was established atCarlisle, Pennsylvania, and a trail cut through theAllegheny Mountains, which became theForbes Road. Already severely ill, Forbes had to be carried in a litter and relied heavily on Bouquet, who commanded the advance guard. Construction of the road and bases such asFort Ligonierwas supervised by Lt-Colonel John St Clair, who proved to be incompetent and required Forbes to do much of the work, despite his poor health.[20]",
            "A less appreciated aspect of Forbes' leadership was in building relationships with local Native Americans, who previously refused to co-operate with the British. These efforts were bolstered by the capture ofFort Frontenacin August, increasing British prestige, while the loss of French traders severely impacted the local economy.[21]This methodical approach was jeopardised by theBattle of Fort Duquesne, on 15 September 1758, when a column under Major James Grant advanced too far ahead of the main body and suffered over 300 casualties. Forbes decided to suspend operations but on 26 October, 13 Ohio Valley tribes signed theTreaty of Eastonwith Pennsylvania andNew Jersey.[22]",
            "After the loss of their local allies, the French abandoned Fort Duquesne and the British took possession on 25 November. Forbes ordered the construction ofFort Pitt, named after British Secretary of StatePitt the Elder. He also established a settlement between the rivers, the site of modernPittsburgh.[23]His health rapidly declined during the campaign; described as a 'wasting disease', this is thought to have been stomach cancer, combined with severedysentery.",
            "On 3 December 1758, he left ColonelHugh Mercerin command and returned toPhiladelphia, where he died on 11 March 1759 and was buried with full military honours. His final correspondence withLord Amherst, the new commander in North America, included the recommendation he make his relationship with Native Americans a priority and 'not to think lightly of them or their friendship.'[24][c]"
